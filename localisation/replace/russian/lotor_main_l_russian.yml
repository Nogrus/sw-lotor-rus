 leviathans.661.desc: "As our mining station orbiting §YDragon's Hoard§! was repositioning to align with a particularly rich mineral vein, sensors picked up something that had hitherto gone undetected.\n\nAn undamaged §YDuinogwuin egg§! in pristine condition, buried beneath the surface of the planetoid and surrounded by the smashed shells of several less fortunate specimens.

It has also been circling around [Root.GetName] unusually often over the last few months, sometimes swooping right past the upper reaches of the atmosphere before pulling away again. Our working hypothesis is that the creature is hungry and wishes to land to feed, as it has periodically done in the past.

 leviathans.540.a.reply: "It was one of several flagships belonging to an unusually powerful interstellar empire called the Amaxine Warriors that flourished in a small region of our galaxy some thousand years ago. Not much is known about their people besides their formidable warrior culture and the fact that they supposedly left the galaxy some thousand years ago in search for another one.\n\nThe Amaxine Dreadnought you have encountered is the last of its kind, and it continues to dutifully patrol its assigned system despite the death of its crew. Many attempts have been made throughout the ages to put the old warship to its final rest - none successful."

Despite the punishment it took from our ships, the structural integrity of the warship's massive hull remains largely intact.\n\nOur boarding parties found the mummified remains of the dreadnought's amaxine crew still manning their stations. Before expiring, they activated some kind of automated patrol mode which the limited shipboard AI has been locked in for the past 937 years.\n\nAlthough it would take an incredible amount of resources, some of our engineers believe that the amaxine dreadnought can be restored and put back into service with our fleet. It would certainly make for a powerful flagship."

# Surveillance Supercomputer ancient relics
 ancrel.12090.desc: "It seems the automated systems in $NAME_Ultima_Vigilis$ are older than we can imagine. The data systems we have hacked do not give us any clues as to the identity or ultimate intentions of its creators, but the one thing we have managed to ascertain is that they arrived no less than 10.000 years ago, and departed soon after setting up the system as an observation post to surveil our entire galaxy.\n\nRemarkably, the system is still operating even after all these years: the array of installations spread across the system are, it turns out, highly sophisticated sensors. They send a live feed to the planet, where the central operating system processes it into information the drones can save and store. Spurred on by shortages of space and matter, it appears that they have improved their data compression techniques with determination: the massive structures on the planet purport to contain the sum of all observations ever recorded. However, we cannot test this assertion, since the data is compressed well beyond our ability to decompress it.\n\nDisturbingly, a reduced stream of \"highlights\" is still being broadcast into empty space. But surely no one is still listening, after all this time? Regardless, our programs are poised to take control of the drones. We may now shape the system to our imagination - if we dare."
