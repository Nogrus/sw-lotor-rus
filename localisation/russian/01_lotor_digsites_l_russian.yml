 lotor_onderon_digsite.1.desc: "Reports have come in of a servant that has stumbled onto a hidden chamber beneath the museum wing of the Royal Palace. Palace security has verified that the chamber is safe, though a large blast door has prevented further exploration. A research team would be required to explore further into the depths of the palace. We suspect it is a tomb, but it may be more..."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.2.name: "A Tight Kept Secret"
 lotor_onderon_digsite.2.desc: "The initial door, while durable, had been badly compromised mechanically and was opened after a few attempts with a security spike. Once through, the team was presented with a number of heavily fortified and electronically sealed blast doors. The research team will start working to make their way through, but it may take some time."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.2.a: "Keep at it. We'll discover the secrets of this place yet."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.3.name: "Alchemical Analysis"
 lotor_onderon_digsite.3.desc: "The research team has achieved its first breakthrough, opening two doors leading into a lab of sorts. In addition to the standard scientific equipment is a large assortment of devices and relics used in Sith alchemy. Dozens of manuscripts detailing methods and results of experiments fill the shelves on one side of the room. Our knowledge of Sith teachings has waned and the opportunity to revel in the experiments of the past should not be forsaken."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.3.a: "Analyze the results of their experiments for the benefit of our people."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.3.b: "Examine the processes and theories to benefit our scientific research."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.4.name: "$lotor_onderon_digsite.3.name$ - Results"
 lotor_onderon_digsite.4.desc.a: "The results of the trials have enlightened us on unnatural abilities by which one's lifespan can be extended. This will benefit all of our people, but most of all will allow our leaders to continue paving a path into the future."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.4.desc.b: "Our scientists are impressed and enlightened examining the procedure and methods of days gone by. They've catalogued and detailed their findings and published these scientific journals to our empire."

 lotor_onderon_digsite.4.b: "May our scientific advancement continue strengthening our empire."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.5.name: "Blades of the Past"
 lotor_onderon_digsite.5.desc: "The glint of war blades shimmered upon the opening of the next blast door. Dozens of stone visages of Sith Warriors stood before them, holding Sith Warblades, their quality beyond anything we can even achieve with modern technology. Past the stone warriors lay dozens more of these blades, all in remarkable shape."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.5.a: "Make use of the blades. While ancient, their quality is beyond measure."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.5.b: "Study their design and crafting methodology, then scrap them."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.6.name: "$lotor_onderon_digsite.5.name$ - Results"
 lotor_onderon_digsite.6.desc.a: "The blades have been moved to the nearby armory for the Royal Guard. Whatever unit uses these weapons will need special training, and there are only so many blades, but they'll surely carve through our enemies with ease."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.6.desc.b: "The design of the blades has given insight to our engineers for future weapons and methods of craftsmanship, as well as the dense blades providing a larger bounty of alloy than one might have initially expected."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.6.a: "May our might guide and safeguard us as we continue to explore the stars."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.6.b: "The echoes of our forebearers will continue to benefit us into the future."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.7.name: "Heart of the Palace"
 lotor_onderon_digsite.7.desc: "After arduous deciphering of the many tomes in the penultimate chamber we've finally released the seal on the final door. The chamber itself was underwhelming, simply a small, dark meditation chamber with wall sconces somehow ablaze after all these centuries. The most striking feature of the room sat on a small, chest height pillar on the far side of the room. An ornate golden pyramid giving off a deep red glow. A Sith holocron."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.7.a: "We will cherish this artifact of our forebearers, as it will bring power and prosperity to our people."

 lotor_onderon_digsite.11.desc: "Word of the previously unknown complex beneath the palace has spread, this fact is all the more evident by the three trespassers taken into custody by the palace guard. How they made their way all the way into the research site is unclear, but this transgression should not go unpunished."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.11.a: "Imprison them to make an example of such negligence."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.11.b: "We will reprimand them and remind them of the importance of this project."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.12.name: "Uninvited Guests Imprisoned"
 lotor_onderon_digsite.12.desc: "The imprisonment of these dissidents has illustrated to the populace what happens when they meddle in affairs beyond them. We need not worry about this happening again."

 lotor_onderon_digsite.14.desc: "A sudden short circuit has sealed a few members of the team in a side chamber! Luckily their holocoms still function and nobody was hurt in the accident. The trapped researchers have basic provisions and can fix the malfunctioning door themselves, though we could expedite the process by having the full team assist them."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.14.a: "We must help them. We're all together in this."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.14.b: "Resume tasks. They'll get themselves out."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.15.name: "Together We Are Stronger"
 lotor_onderon_digsite.15.desc: "The malfunctioning door took longer than anticipated to open, even with the whole team putting forth their efforts. Still, those inside are now safe, and the comradery between them is at an all time high."
 lotor_onderon_digsite.16.name: "Each On Their Own"
 lotor_onderon_digsite.16.desc: "A few days passed before the door slid open, those trapped inside were mentally and physically drained. It's clear that a rift has formed in the team, and not all of them trust their leader. But they're all professionals, and will continue their duties."

 lotor_digsites.2.a: "Keep at it. We must be close to a breakthrough."
 lotor_digsites.3.name: "Two Breakthroughs"
 lotor_digsites.3.desc: "It just so happens both teams have found success in their efforts: The exploratory team has come across one of the \"petals\" of the mechanical flower, while the deciphering team has derived coordinates from the mural. The design of the \"petal\" lends credence to the flower being a mechanical structure, consisting of unknown metals, hydraulic parts, and some form of holographic emitter."

 lotor_digsites.4.desc: "With both teams together and headway from the translated mural, the site of the mechanical flower was uncovered a short ways away, half buried in a small valley. After verifying the valley was safe, a camp was erected to study the artifact. While broken and inoperable, the team claims they'll be able to fix it with time, once fully excavated of course."
 lotor_digsites.4.a: "Begin the excavation."
 lotor_digsites.5.name: "Piecing Things Together"
 lotor_digsites.5.desc: "Both the advanced nature of the technology and the materials the artifact is crafted from have made repairing and reactivating the flower an arduous task. The team continues to work hard and break down any barriers that arise in their mission to get this artifact working, though it is slow going. Still, §Y[This.Leader.GetName]§! assures us that it can be done." # This = fleet

Upon reactivation, the arms extended and the glowing centerpiece appeared, the centerpiece actually in the form of an ancient star map! While it doesn't lead to any planet or system in particular, the way in which the hyperspace lanes are laid out in tandem with navigational data regarding gravity wells and black holes is a massive boon to our attempts at furthering astrogation speed and efficiency." # This = fleet

 lotor_digsites.11.desc: "In all the time spent exploring the city, the team has uncovered surprisingly little about the fate of its inhabitants. The barren streets provide nothing more than a vague grasp on the society's travel habits, while the buildings are so empty the team has taken to calling them 'hollow'. Stranger still, now that the team is in the city, scanners seem to be picking up faint signs of life in a number of areas."

In addition to discovering the name of the city, §HVaale§!, the white stone it's comprised of seems to be alive in some strange capacity. Thus far nothing seems to indicate that this living matter has any form of sentience, seeming to be analogous to a type of hardened bone more than actual stone.

 lotor_digsites.13.desc: "Even with the sheer emptiness of the city, answers could not be kept from us forever. After combing a number of databases and written record in a variety of locations throughout §HVaale§! we've discovered the founders of this city were a secluded group of artisans called §HThe Architects of Vaale§!. Along with this discovery came the records of a number of artifacts by their design, most interestingly a pair of rings that provide the wearer with \"immense power\". The nature of this power was not explicitly stated, but the prospect of uncovering such artifacts has become the new focus of the team."

 lotor_digsites.14.desc: "It seems we'd been looking in the wrong place all this time. After an extensive search, a passage beneath the city was uncovered beneath the rubble of what seems to be a building that housed the government of §HVaale§!. Exploration into this passage has led to a large, ornate door covered in a macabre mural. While studying it, members of the research team have reported a profound sense of dread. It's clear that whatever is hidden behind the door would provide answers about this city and the fate of its inhabitants, as well as potential artifacts, but at what cost?"

Their last report indicates they were close to opening the strange door beneath the city of §HVaale§!, and that the sense of dread they had been feeling had worsened.

A number of them rushed into the room, which appeared to be some form of workshop and storage area, destroying whatever they could find. §Y[missing_crew_ship.Leader.GetName]§! and the remaining sane members gathered what little they could from the workshop before escaping. Unfortunately, the madness inflicted upon the crew had been long brewing, and the ship's hyperdrive and communications had been sabotaged.\n\nFortunately §Y[missing_crew_ship.Leader.GetName]§! and the remaining team members were able to repair the ship, returning with a number of artifacts, including the so called §MRing of Immortality§!.
