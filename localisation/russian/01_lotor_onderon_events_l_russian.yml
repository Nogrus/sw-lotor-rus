 lotor_onderon_events.1.desc: "Calamity has befallen our great city! On the eve of the 5th anniversary of the union between our King and Queen, and thus the end of hostilities between the people of §YIziz§! and the §YBeast Riders§!, an unprecedented assault has taken place. Hundreds of assailants riding upon beasts and piloting ships, calling themselves the §YSons of Modon§!, attacked the city under the pretense that the §YBeast Riders§! should have subjugated the people of §YIziz§! and not joined them. They also seem to accuse those who had previously been §YBeast Riders§! now living in §YIziz§!, including our King, of betraying them and their ways.\n\nOur defense forces responded quickly to this sudden threat, having driven the threat from our walls, but not before much devastation had been wreaked upon the city and its people. Defensive forces have reported the hostile faction having fled into the jungle. It is likely the §YSons of Modon§! will return if not hunted down, their base likely hidden somewhere in the jungles of §Y[onderon_planet.GetName]§!. But we must attend to the rebuilding of the city first and foremost."

Though while our city heals physically, the people are growing restless. War between the people of §YIziz§! and the §YBeast Riders§! is still fresh in the minds of our subjects and this attack serves as a grim reminder of the losses so many had to endure.\n\nWhat's more, the so called §YSons of Modon§! draw their namesake from the late father of our great King, drawing the attention of the people. While nobody is openly questioning current leadership given the past five years of relative prosperity, a statement should be made to settle the nerves of our people, both those originating from §YIziz§! and those that joined with the original §YBeast Riders§!.

Whether they are destroyed, captured, or sent retreating to the stars is irrelevant at this time as first and foremost we must find their base, or bases, of operation. Preliminary scouting efforts have had little success. §Y[This.GetName]§! is a vast planet covered densely with vegetation and finding an enemy force, regardless of its size, is no small feat.\n\nOur military leadership has requested additional funding and manpower in finding the enemy's base of operations. They argue that utilizing our current scouts and equipment on a larger scale will take defensive resources away from our city and leave it vulnerable. Moreover, while they estimate we can find the §YSons of Modon§! without these additional resources, it may take an exceptionally long time without further support. They also state that if we can only accommodate one of their requests, the funding would likely go further than providing additional manpower, so we may want to weigh that accordingly.\n\nIt is ultimately the monarch's decision regarding the release additional funding to the military for this operation, as well as requesting volunteers for additional manpower." # this = planet

 lotor_onderon_events.8.desc: "Our scouts have finally tracked the §YSons of Modon§! back to their base of operations. Their detection couldn't have come at a more opportune time as they seem to be starting mobilization for another potential offensive on §YIziz§!. Our military leadership has been cautious with their reaction to this news, making sure not to bolster the city defenses and potentially alert them to our knowledge of their location and mobilization. If they complete their mobilization we will make our move to defend the city, but military leadership advises a preemptive strike upon the §YSons of Modon's§! base of operation before they complete preparations.\n\nEven if we hold a greater advantage given defensive positioning in §YIziz§!, there will surely be collateral damage and deaths among the civilian population if we wait. That said, assaulting their base of operations would take a more significant force than defending our city. One proposed alternative would be an orbital bombardment of the §YSons of Modon§!, though some advise against this given the potential damage to the surrounding area, as well as the likely outright destruction of enemy. If they are ever to try and see eye to eye with us ever again, destroying them from orbit will likely make such a thing impossible.\n\nWhatever decision is made regarding the §YSons of Modon§! must be made quickly, as their mobilization efforts will continue as we decide. If we are to assault their base from the ground, estimates say we will need at least three ground armies, whereas if we are to bombard them from orbit we need a fleet of at least 8 vessels. If we decide to wait out their mobilization and brace for an attack, we will be prepared and should be able to defend our city without additional support, but the damage may be severe. We should have enough time to mobilize some of our own armies or construct additional ships for our navy, but we must do so with haste if we are to attack."

 lotor_onderon_events.9.desc: "The §YSons of Modon§! were caught off guard by our preemptive strike! Their scouts caught wind of our approaching armies too late to prepare an adequate defense. This, along with our previous scouting of the area, enabled a rapid and calculated operation under the leadership of §Y[From.GetLeaderName]§!. Preliminary reports show minor losses among our forces and heavy losses for the enemy, though they were not wiped out, nor did they surrender in the face of our overwhelming attack. Instead, a squadron of freighter ships hidden deep in their territory were used to evacuate a significant number of their people.\n\nGiven the unexpected nature of this evacuation and the resistance our force encountered, we were unable to stop these ships from fleeing from the planet. Shortly after exiting §Y[onderon_planet.GetName]'s§! atmosphere these ships fled towards the §Y[sons_of_modon_system.GetName]§! system before leaving sensor range. If this conflict is to truly end, we must track down and deal with the remaining §YSons of Modon§!. Those of the enemy left on the planet who did not perish in the battle have surrendered and will no longer be a threat, though the manner in which we deal with them must be decided. A few hundred of these individuals have been taken prisoner and how they are dealt with may influence the perception of our people and the surviving members of the §YSons of Modon§!."

 lotor_onderon_events.10.desc: "Our scouts did their job well. The §YSons of Modon§! began their trek through and above the forests of §Y[onderon_planet.GetName]§! in an attempt to assault §YIziz§! in the morning hours before sunrise. Upon their arrival, they were met with the full strength of our military and security forces defending from both inside the walls and from hardened positions along the perimeter. Their tactics were similar to the last assault with an emphasis on speed, hitting targets and running, just with a bit more firepower and larger numbers than before. These tactics lost effectiveness against a prepared enemy, however, their extra firepower spread across too many targets to deal significant damage and their larger numbers counting for naught when facing such a stout defense.\n\nThis attack buffeted our walls for a mere thirty minutes before the §YSons of Modon§! were sent into a full retreat. Our forces received negligible losses, though our walls suffered significant damage in the fighting, as well as civilian structures becoming damaged and engulfed in flame as handfuls of flying adversaries were able to pass over the walls. Still, both losses and damage to the city was kept low given our preparation.\n\nStrangely enough, a short time after the last of the §YSons of Modon§! retreated into the forest, scanners in §YIziz§! picked up a sizable squadron of freighter vessels lifting off from the planet's surface. Our scouts in the forest verified that the remaining §YSons of Modon§! boarded these hidden vessels and have fled the planet following their defeat. While our people rejoice at this news, it is possible that the enemy will return one day. Given their projected path towards §Y[sons_of_modon_system.GetName]§! it may be prudent to track them down and attempt to end them once and for all."

 lotor_onderon_events.11.desc: "The §YSons of Modon§! were caught off guard by our preemptive strike! Without warning their staging area was bombarded by all manner of turbolasers and explosives, all of our forward scouts having evacuated to a safe distance before bombardment could begin. Shortly after the bombardment began a squadron of freighter ships hidden deep in their territory lifted off in a seeming attempt to evacuate. In tandem, a small fighter contingent attacked our fleet, though inflicted superficial damage. This may have been by design, however, as the fighters stalled our fleet long enough for most of the freighters to jump into hyperspace in the direction of §Y[sons_of_modon_system.GetName]§!.\n\nThis sudden evacuation and escape from [onderon_planet.GetName] was an unaccounted for possibility given the unseen freighters, though at most is a minor setback. If this conflict is to truly end, we must track down and deal with the remaining §YSons of Modon§!. Those of the enemy left on the planet who did not perish in the battle have been left broken, either dead or dying as they scatter into the forest. Scans and low flyovers tell that only a few dozen may have survived and will likely be taken by the wildlife of [onderon_planet.GetName]! before long."

Given our intelligence gathered from the encampment on §Y[onderon_planet.GetName]§! combined with shipboard scan, there does seem to be truth to their claims. If the freighters were full of exclusively soldiers and beasts then a far greater force could have attacked §YIziz§!.\n\nThe representative of the §YSons of Modon§! states that they are simply recuperating and reorganizing before retreating further from §Y[onderon_planet.GetName]§!, having chosen exile rather than surrender or extermination, and pleads for us to leave them be.

She asserted that the success and prosperity of our people was just as much the work of the average person as it was §HOron Kira§!'s leadership and that we're all in this together. With that being the case, the melancholic air shifted to one of surprise as the Queen announced her abdication of the throne in the coming days.\n\nShe stated that for too long the leadership of §YOnderon§! has been bound simply to the bloodline of §YFreedon Nadd§! and that from henceforth not only will the Monarch carry the Nadd line, but also the line of §HOron Kira§!, the man who united §YOnderon§!. With this, the soon to be abdicated Queen announced that §HTalia Kira§!, daughter of Oron and Galia, will take the crown as new Queen of §YOnderon§!.

Basilisk War Droids, troop transports, and Davaab-type starfighters blazed down from the sky over §YIziz§! before assaulting our great city, all while our fleets flew helplessly above, unable to support without damaging the city.

These tactics were put to good use, letting the invaders pass before using explosives to drop entire buildings upon them, destroying their War Droids and nullifying the benefit of their beskar armor.

 lotor_onderon_events.112.desc: "Our interrogations into the attempted sabotage at the Royal Space Dock in §YIziz§! have finally started to bear fruit. After analyzing and cross referencing the individuals' stories and explanations, it's been concluded that the sabotage was indeed an anti-Republic operation by disgruntled citizens. While some details still aren't lining up, a few of them have let slip the existence of a small safe house the saboteurs used prior to their attempted sabotage which our investigators have found. In addition, another detail was given in an attempt to lessen the individual's sentence. The group of saboteurs was tipped off by an unknown party as to the arrival of the freighters from §YRepublic§! space and were provided access codes to staff areas of the Royal Space Dock.\n\nInvestigators can verify the validity of this claim, having recovered multiple datapads from the safe house that detail the communication with this unknown party. Specific details are hard to come by given the vague, guarded nature of these messages, as well as encryption on most files. Our intel team is hard at work to break the encryption in search for answers.\n\nOne additional detail that may factor into the situation is moderate level contraband was found on one of the freighters in question. While a small amount of contraband isn't entirely unusual given the volume of shipment moving through the dock, both the amount and types of illicit items make it hard to believe it wouldn't be caught in §YRepublic§! space prior to their departure. The contents of the freighter may have resulted in harm to our city at a small scale, a few of the illicit materials being drugs and low grade weapons, though it is harm nevertheless. However, continued receiving of these contraband shipments over time could cause more substantial, systemic harm to our people. If contraband of this type has been slipping past us, it is no wonder the saboteurs felt validated in their actions."

 lotor_onderon_events.113.desc: "The encryption on the files contained within the datapads was surprisingly easy for our intelligence officers to crack. While this may seem like good news, it also has brought light to a startling discovery. The files were well encrypted, but the encryption was done through methods that much of our own high level social and military infrastructure use, hence the ease of our officers in deciphering the encryption. While royal matters and command level military communication and files are more heavily encrypted, it begs the question of a possible technological compromise to much of our society.\n\nLuckily, this potentially disturbing revelation came with good news. The original message from the unknown party to the saboteurs has been recovered and what's more, one of our officers has managed to trace the communication back to the source. As we speak our forces are moving in on the transmission location here in §YIziz§!. We will report news of the situation once the raid has been completed."

 lotor_onderon_events.114.desc: "The raid was a resounding success! A small group has been apprehended from the safe house, having confirmed them to be the source of the message received by the saboteurs. Now we have both the saboteurs and these new potential accomplices in custody. This, however, is where the things seem to become decidedly more complicated.\n\nIn stark contrast to the original saboteurs, these new suspects seem more than happy to provide us with any and all information on the situation. Contrary to our suspicions these individuals do not seem to be of the same anti-Republic sentiment as the saboteurs. Instead they admit to being pro-Republic and knowingly leaked the information about the recently arrived freighters, while also tipping off security at the Royal Space Dock of the impending saboteurs.\n\nThe §YRepublic§! sympathizers see this situation as them helping to reveal a group of individuals, the saboteurs, willing to cause monetary, physical, and potentially political harm to §YIziz§! through their actions. Moreover, the §YRepublic§! sympathizers have admitted to slicing into §YIziz§! infrastructure for information and to \"keep tabs\" on the goings of the city. While obviously having broken a number of laws through their actions, these pro-Republic activists maintain they have not caused harm and have only acted of their own volition to try and keep the city safe, while exposing potential threats. The irony that they may have facilitated threats to the city through their actions, like with providing information to the saboteurs, seems lost upon them.\n\nFor now, we will leave investigators to clear up any last details and scour the datapads of both parties one last time. A public sentencing will be held in a few days time, for our people must be made aware of the machinations within our city, and for them to see us render judgement on these individuals."

 lotor_onderon_events.115.desc: "The day of the sentencing has arrived and a crowd in the thousands has amassed to observe and listen. Both groups at hand have knowingly broken our laws and, while their crimes may not be equal, await judgement. Regardless of our choices, a concerning truth has arisen from the situation: Our people are beginning to take matters into their own hands regarding our potential alignment with the §YRepublic§!. We may be losing our grip on our own people. Our decisions today regarding these individuals fate may reinforce citizens' allegiance or sew their treachery. Only time will tell which.\n\nThe first matter at hand: The individuals apprehended at the Royal Space Port with the intent of sabotaging commercial freighters with military grade explosives, hereby known as the \"Saboteurs\". The Saboteurs do not claim innocence of the attempted sabotage, though all make it abundantly clear that whatever damage they would be localized to the freighters and cargo themselves, not any crew or the actual hangars of the space port. Their insistence on this detail illustrates the severity of their charges. Past these assurances the individuals claim that the rise in harmful drugs, weapons, and substances primarily stem from contraband smuggled in from the §YRepublic§!. They claim that our inaction regarding such things was validation for their attempted sabotage, as it was to protect the people of §YIziz§!. Yet past any validation or rationalizing their attempted actions, they still intended to destroy property with explosives at our Royal Space Dock while potentially endangering innocents and sewing chaos. Past the surface of the crimes, it isn't lost on the crowd that destroying §YRepublic§! freighters holds significance to each citizen's particular allegiance and beliefs."

Valid points have been made in support of the Saboteurs in some of our people's eyes, but laws have been broken, and the ends don't quite justify the means.\n\nExiling the individuals would show to our people we will not tolerate such actions whatsoever, removing them from our society completely. People may interpret such a course of action as protecting §YRepublic§! interests and ties at the cost of our own people, but their intended crime was great and may be fitting of such a punishment.\n\nImprisonment would somewhat satisfy all parties, not outright condemning the individuals to a fate outside our city. Regardless of whether our people find their actions warranted or not, all will understand there must be punishment for such crimes, and the imprisoned individuals may one day rejoin our society.\n\nFreeing these individuals would be a bold, unprecedented course of action. Laws were broken and confessed to and our people would expect some form of action to be taken. Freeing the Saboteurs makes a statement that can only be interpreted by our people as anti-§YRepublic§! sentiment being endorsed by our leadership.\n\nOur decision will have a lasting impression on our people, both in terms of what they believe is appropriate and what they come to believe our government stands for. We should take care with what we choose."

Silence falls over those that have gathered as they listen to the charges levied at the second group of suspects, hereby dubbed the \"Slicers\", given their primary charge during this sentencing.\n\nThese individuals were apprehended in relation to the Saboteurs as potential accomplices, having provided information to them prior to the sabotage attempt. Further investigation led to the realization that the hackers, while providing information to the Saboteurs, were working to get the Saboteurs arrested by \"setting them up\" so to speak. While this intent from some perspectives may seem admirable, the methods by which they went about doing so were careless, endangering lives, property, and public order. Moreover, whispers from the crowd indicate they seem to be adding together that this group, in attempting to \"sacrifice\" the Saboteurs, may in turn be §YRepublic§! sympathizers trying to make their independence focused brethren appear in a poor light.\n\nPutting aside the specifics regarding their involvement in the attempted sabotage, through both confession and investigation into their hideout we've determined the Slicers to have sliced into most levels of infrastructure in the city of §YIziz§!. This fact alone brings with it a litany of charges for the slicers, though they insist they have performed no illegal actions upon gaining access to data and systems within our city. The Slicers, like the Saboteurs, cite the rise in drugs, weapons, and substances as a basis for their actions in slicing city infrastructure to gain a better understanding of their origin and how they permeate through §YIziz§!."

Clear condemnation and support has been overtaken by a fervor simply demanding \"justice\", though the definition of such a thing seems to vary greatly from person to person. The guards presiding over the crowd force a moment of calm for our decision to be made.\n\nExiling them would make it clear that we will not tolerate such actions, removing them from our society completely. Those that value the sovereignty and unity of our kingdom will likely view this in a positive light as the individuals were manipulating our own people and exposing our infrastructure, though some may see their actions as warranted in exposing dangerous citizens in our midst.\n\nImprisonment would be a somewhat neutral option, not outright condemning the individuals to a fate outside our city. Regardless of whether our people find their actions warranted or not, all will understand there must be punishment for such crimes, and the imprisoned individuals may one day rejoin our society.\n\nFreeing these individuals would likely surprise the populace and may bring concern. Laws were broken and confessed to and our people would expect some form of action to be taken. Freeing the Slicers would give the impression that manipulating fellow countrymen through illegal means for a supposed \"greater good\" is allowed in our society, sewing distrust and paranoia. In addition to that, such manipulation was based in pro and anti-§YRepublic§! sentiment, likely furthering the divide in our people on this matter.\n\nOur decision will continue to impress upon our people along with the previous sentencing, the outcome unclear."

Most individuals make their way onto the streets of §YIziz§! in an orderly fashion, though a sizable number continue making themselves heard before our government's representation at the sentencing. The voices of the remaining crowd grow loud with questions as to our relationship with the §YRepublic§! and the way which we govern, given the events of today's sentencing. These voices suddenly fell silent, a silence punctuated by a blaster bolt ringing out from the crowd and slamming into the podium where our representatives stood.\n\nCries of panic filled the air as the remaining crowd-members ran, flooding out onto the streets as chaos ensued. Quickly our guardsmen moved to secure the government officials before trying to discern who in the crowd fired the blaster, though it was a wasted effort as the crowd was too dense and was moving too quickly. Evacuating the officials went smoothly once secured, and luckily only a handful in the crowd were injured in the rush to escape what could only be an attempted assassination on one of our officials.\n\nIt's become abundantly clear from today's events that our people grow more divided by the day, devolving into attempts of violence and chaos. Even our officials, both military and state, are beginning to disagree on matters. What was once a problem only to the lower echelons of society has now grown to divide even our leaders. If a common ground cannot be found soon we may find our great city gripped by worse than angry, divided crowds."

Disputes and arguments previously discussed only among our politicians have become common talking points among our people, sometimes devolving into public disturbances or even brawls. The city guard has been tasked with keeping these occurrences to a minimum, defusing any situations before potential violence or riots can break out.\n\nOur political leaders were also galvanized by the sentencing and the attempt on their lives, though what each of them took away from that day differs person to person. The rather violent disagreements exhibited by our people have begun to bleed into politics as well with different representatives taking the fervor of the people to heart. §HGeneral Vaklu§! has used this opportunity to drum up his support even further, though this time has begun to publicly question §HQueen Talia§! and her rule, his statements bordering on treason.\n\nWhile we are a monarchy, representatives and leaders along with nobles throughout the city have always made sure the voices of the people are heard. Treasonous statements questioning our rulers haven't been spoken by representatives of the people since the joining of the §YBeast Riders§! and the people of §YIziz§! many decades ago. Such a thing cannot be taken lightly, yet the support for §HGeneral Vaklu§! has become so significant there seems to be no simple solution.

All theorizing quickly becomes irrelevant as the true motive behind the violence is made clear:\n\n§HGeneral Vaklu§! has begun an insurrection! His forces, dubbed the §YSecessionists§!, have begun attacking strategic points throughout the city while working quickly to isolate the city from any exterior forces. A sizable portion of our military seems to comprise the majority of §HVaklu's§! forces. The city guard and royal guards however seem to be staying true to the crown and defending §HQueen Talia§!, these forces dubbed the §YRoyalists§!.\n\nFighting throughout the city has begun in earnest, pillars of smoke rising from each district as battles rage. §YIziz§! is a large city and both warring parties number in the thousands, meaning this conflict may span days until a victor is decided. That is, if the leaders of both parties live that long. §HGeneral Vaklu's§! forces are closing in on the Royal Palace in a likely attempt on §HQueen Talia's§! life to put an end to the Civil War."

The §HSecessionists§! seem to have the upper hand for the moment, though the strength of the Queen and her guard should not be underestimated. Not to mention other potential factors at play.\n\nRegardless, the time may have come for the representatives of the people, the §HCouncil of Lords§!, to choose a side in this conflict and impose what little pressure they can upon the outcome. The §HCouncil§! declaring their support in the midst of the battle, especially in as the fighting overtakes the palace, may weigh upon those whose allegiances are uncertain in this tumultuous situation. Noble families carry weight not only in terms of status, but also with their familial guardsmen, Ancestral Wardens. While some of these Wardens are surely engaging in the fighting already, an official statement by the §HCouncil§! may shift inclination towards our monarch or the usurper.\n\nThis is not a decision to be made lightly as it may be one of the single most significant choices in the growth of our Kingdom.

However, her insistence on furthering ties with the §YRepublic§! has drawn the ire of many in recent times. Her outward thinking to many seems to come at the cost of their history and culture, preferring new and foreign ideas opposed to familiarity and safety. Worries that §YOnderon§! will just become another in a list of core worlds under the §YRepublic's§! boot is a primary reason behind the conflict currently gripping the city. Whether trusting and closer ties to the §YRepublic§! is a mistake is yet to be seen, but §HTalia§! is optimistic about our future, even if it means leaving elements of the past behind us. If the §YRoyalists§! succeed, the monarchy will continue, though the future is unclear.\n\n§HGeneral Vaklu§! is the cousin of §HQueen Talia§! and has legitimate claim to the throne, though not as rightful as our Queen. The General has always been a respected soldier and conducted himself with honor, having become a household name throughout §YIziz§! with his defense against the §YMandalorians§!. This act is one of the criticisms brought up to counter §HQueen Talia's§! hopes to grow closer with the §YRepublic§!; Our own forces fought away the §YMandalorians§! threat, not the §YRepublic§!.

This war has only seemed to punctuate the many tumultuous years our Kingdom has endured. The Great Sith War, The Beast Wars, the Son's of Modon Uprising, Mandalorian incursions and the Mandalorian Crusades. Yet our Kingdom endures.\n\nEven in the face of all the adversity we've endured, our people have taken to a new found optimism that the worst is behind us. §HQueen Talia§!, the rightful Queen, shall be the one to see our Kingdom into this unclear future. With her leadership, the Kingdom shall move forth unshackled by our past, looking to the stars for new ideas and information all while bringing the culture and splendor of our people to the galactic community. Whether this future brings continued independence or allegiance to a greater galactic power such as the §YRepublic§! is to be seen, but regardless of this, the future of §YOnderon§! seems bright."
