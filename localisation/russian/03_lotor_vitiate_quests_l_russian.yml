 lotor_vitiate_quests.1.name: "Path to Immortality"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.1.desc: "The future of the Sith is all but ensured. Attempts to regain our prestige and influence in the galaxy have been met with disastrous results up until now. Our losses against the Republic, as well as the loss of Korriban left us in a weakened state.\n\nHowever, following the ritual on Nathema the [Root.GetRulerTitle] gained new powers and a prolonged lifespan. But the pursuit for immortality continues and with an undying [Root.GetRulerTitle], we will endure and be able to strike back against the decaying Republic. In his quest for immortality, the [Root.GetRulerTitle] plans to visit a few worlds valued by the Sith to commune with the Dark Side. The first will be Yavin IV."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.1.a: "Prepare the [Root.GetRulerTitle]'s shuttle."

 NAME_Vitiate_Ship: "Assault Shuttle"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.2.name: "The Massassi Temples of Yavin IV"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.2.desc: "Yavin IV was one of the worlds we fled following our defeat in the Great Hyperspace War. Here, Naga Sadow and some Massassi warriors toiled in secret, hidden away from the Republic and the Jedi. He also trained Freedon Nadd, the future master of the legendary Exar Kun.\n\nThe shuttle lands in the dense jungle near the Great Temple, the [Root.GetRulerTitle] feels the powerful dark side energy deep within. As the [Root.GetRulerTitle] goes deeper into the catacombs, he focuses his rage and sees a myriad of images from the past."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.2.a: "Focus on the legacy of Sadow."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.2.b: "Focus on the legacy of Kun."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.3.name: "The History of Sadow and Kun"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.3.desc: "While Sadow lived in exile, he created numerous abominations and performed cruel experiments on the Massassi. Sadow's machinations were short lived as Nadd betrayed and killed him. Nadd himself was then betrayed, even as a spirit, by Exar Kun. And Kun himself seemingly died, although his presence is felt among the ruins of this temple.\n\nThe [Root.GetRulerTitle] comes out of his seething meditation. The vision reveals to him the ritual Exar Kun performed in an attempt to defeat death. Although it never succeeded, it bound the fallen Jedi's spirit to the temples on the planet."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.3.a: "There is potential here."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.4.name: "The Dark Side Creature"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.4.desc: "As the [Root.GetRulerTitle] returns to his shuttle, he senses something lurking nearby. Before he can react, a terentatek crashes through the dense foliage and attacks. Not to be outdone by mere Sithspawn, he hurls force lightning at the beast. It bellows in agony, feeling only a portion of the [Root.GetRulerTitle]'s wrath. With one last attempt at charging, the beast collapses, smoke rising from the blackened scutes.\n\nAlthough what he had learned from Yavin was minimal, it did reveal that he was not the only one seeking to avoid death. Exar Kun's attempt was a step forward at best. The fact these creatures are awakening delight the [Root.GetRulerTitle]. Older legends mentioned that the terentateks awake only when the dark side becomes strong again.\n\nAboard the shuttle the [Root.GetRulerTitle] pours over this star charts. Korriban remains cut off but there was a Sith presence on the dark world of Malachor V. He sets the coordinates and heads toward the system."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.4.a: "To Malachor."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.5.name: "The Dark Side Nexus of Malachor V"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.5.desc: "The [Root.GetRulerTitle]'s shuttle lands and he surveys the landscape. The planet is surrounded by dark side energy. He notices a crumbling structure in the distance. There were some that traveled with him that separated from the rest of the "True Sith" on their way to Dromund Kaas and this must have been where they ended up."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.5.a: "Dark Places Where Few Tread..."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.6.name: "The abandoned Academy"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.6.desc: "The [Root.GetRulerTitle] reaches the ruins of the academy and studies the remnants of the Sith presence on this world. The academy ruins yielded little in way of new insights into the path to immortality. Instead, it appeared as if they were more preoccupied by old stories ranging from a lost tribe to a failed quest for immortality. However, it did seem as if the Sith here were pursuing something based off the legend of two Sith lords.\n\nAccording to the legend, Darth Noctyss was pursuing the secret to immortality and went to Ixigul, an old bastion of the Sith. She came across a lowly creature that aided her study using the lab of a Sith lord named Darth Sanguis. She performed a ritual that led to the sacrifice of the creature. However, the ritual turned her into the same, malformed creature that aided her and allowed Sanguis to be free of his deformed state.\n\nHe returns to his ship empty handed and sets the course to the site of the first ritual, the one that granted him even greater power."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.6.a: "There's Always Some Truth to Legends."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.7.name: "The barren wastelands of Nathema"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.7.desc: "The shuttle makes landfall on the dead world of Nathema. Not so long ago, the planet was a valuable agriworld for the Sith. However, following a ritual performed by [Root.GetRulerName] using Sith magic and an ancient super weapon, the planet was turned into a desolate wasteland, only occupied by lone voreclaws. In spite of this, the Ritual of Nathema was hailed by Sith scholars as one of the crowning achievements of the old Sith Empire.\n\n[Root.GetRulerName] sits and meditates, contemplating his next move. The Ritual of Nathema was an ambitious attempt that succeeded..."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.7.a: "But what if it was possible to do it again..."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.7.b: "But what if it was perfected..."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.8.name: "The Ritual Of Nathema"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.8.desc: "The Ritual of Nathema was possible through Sith magic and the use of an old superweapon called the Zildrog. The weapon was stored in a Sith temple and sits abandoned, awaiting reactivation. An attempt to do a ritual such as that again would require more souls; a whole planet's worth of souls.\n\n$lotor_vitiate_quests.8.9.desc.common$"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.8.a: "Maybe it is time to return to Dromund Kaas and dwell on this further..."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.9.desc: "An attempt to do a ritual such as that again would require more souls; a whole planet's worth of souls. It is possible to perform such a feat without needing to rely on some alien machinery. All it takes is a war that could span the galaxy. The Zildrog can gather dust deep underneath an old temple as long as possible.\n\n$lotor_vitiate_quests.8.9.desc.common$"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.8.9.desc.common: "The general populace was kept in the dark about the ritual. Nathema was removed from all records, leaving only the name of the ritual. Not only did it grant him a form of immortality but it ensured he was able to form the remnants of the old Sith Empire into his image. He could do it again, if all the conditions were right...\n\n[Root.GetRulerName]'s ruminations are interrupted by growing dark side presence elsewhere. Stronger than what he had felt on Yavin and Malachor. Something is stirring elsewhere in the galaxy."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.100.name: "Another Dark Side Power"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.100.desc: "The Dark Council reports that the [Root.GetRulerTitle] has felt a disturbance in the Force following his pilgrimage to old Sith worlds. He senses a growing dark side presence somewhere in the Outer Rim that is slowly spreading. This strange flux of dark side energy is also felt by not only the [Root.GetRulerTitle] but members of the Dark Council and the Sith population in general.\n\nThe [Root.GetRulerTitle] recommends sending a survey team out to find the exact location of this mysterious force and assess if it truly threatens the Empire."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.100.a: "It shall be done, my lord."

 ANOTHER_DARKSIDE_POWER_1: "The Growing Disturbance"
 ANOTHER_DARKSIDE_POWER_1_DESC: "We managed to pinpoint the disturbance that we felt to a planet in the [vitiate_quest_2_system.GetName] system. We should send a science ship to investigate immediately."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.101.name: "The Station"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.101.desc: "The crew of the [This.GetName] has seemingly vanished. The last holocall mentioned a strange space station orbiting [vitiate_quest_2_planet.GetName] that looked as if it was overgrown and a strong dark side presence surrounding it. It ended with the sound of the ship's docking clamps connecting to the station.\n\nThe [FromFrom.GetRulerTitle], for the first time in his existence, is disturbed by how powerful this presence is and how it threatens him."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.101.a: "I have a bad feeling about this..."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.102.name: "Unknown Transmission"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.102.desc: "We've just received another transmission from an unknown source and it sounds as if its from the ship's Droid. It is unclear how recent it is but the Droid seems to be panicking: §H'This transmission is for the Dark Council and the Emperor of the Sith Empire. We have found the source of this dark side presence aboard the space station. We need help! There are plants here that are living off of dark side energy. They've killed the original inhabitants! They-'§!\n\nThe transmission is interrupted by the sounds of combat. Faint screams and the sound of blasters and lightsabers growing closer. For a brief second the transmission picks up the sound of blast doors closing and the scientist steps into view with two assistants. §H'They've sealed off our escape! We can't reach the ship! We can't kill them! Here is our loca-'§!. Before they are able to finish, there is a loud crash and strange hissing and groaning. The rest of the transmission is nothing but pure horror, fates worst than the citizens of Nathema could have ever experienced.\n\nThe [FromFrom.GetRulerTitle], outraged by the footage and clear threat to the Empire has ordered the destruction of these horrid plants and will see to it himself."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.102.a: "They died in service of the Empire."

 lotor_vitiate_quests.103.desc: "The [This.GetRulerTitle] sits in his chamber, meditating and harnessing the power of the Dark Side. Suddenly, he feels that same dark side presence he had sensed on Nathema. A holocall comes in from an Imperial Moff from [vitiate_quest_2_target_planet.GetName] reporting a sudden appearance of unknown ships. All attempts to hail the vessels were met with silence and they have opened fire on the station,\n\nThey request immediate support before they take the system."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.103.a: "Ready the fleet. They will face the [This.GetRulerTitle]'s wrath."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.104.name: "The Root of the Problem"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.104.desc: "We've crushed the hijacked fleet in the [vitiate_quest_2_target_planet.System.GetName] system. We have recovered some information on the whereabouts of the last location of our crew and what happened to them. It appears that these plant-like creatures can passively possess sentients and drive them into madness. With this information, the [This.GetRulerTitle] orders the fleet out to the given coordinates."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.104.a: "We will end this madness where it began."
 ANOTHER_DARKSIDE_POWER_2: "Annihilation"
 ANOTHER_DARKSIDE_POWER_2_DESC: "The inhabitants of the strange space station, some plant-like creatures are able to passively possess sentients and drive them into madness. Using such methods they have gathered a fleet and dared to attack us. We must go back to the station and destroy them."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.105.name: "The Unknown Creatures"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.105.desc: "The fleet has arrived at the infested station. The troop transports head toward the docking bays, escorted by fighters. The [This.GetRulerTitle] also lands with his own retinue. They cut through the blast doors and head deep into the station. There is a brief comms chatter, but the [This.GetRulerTitle] demands silence. For the longest time the station is silent, save for the uneasy breathing of the soldiers, their footsteps, and the creaking of branches.\n\nThey enter the central hub of the station and find the remains of the station's inhabitants, as well as the mangled bodies of the expeditionary team and discarded droid components. The gruesome sight is worsened by the sight of the plants. Their §H'heads'§! are filled with teeth and long tentacle-like tendrils extended from their §H'torso'§!. The largest mass sits in the middle, surrounded by four large statues with shackles around their wrists. They remind him of ones found deep in Korriban's tombs.\n\nThe largest of the botanical monstrosities speaks: §H'Nourish us or be one with us. The choice is yours.'§!"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.105.a: "For the Empire!"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.106.name: "Weeding the Garden"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.106.desc: "The battle rages inside the space station as the forces of the [This.GetName] fight these monsters. The creatures lash out with their tendrils, crushing and grabbing soldiers and consuming them. A Sith warrior lunges at one of them with their lightsaber and slices it in two, only for it to become two creatures. Blasters seem to do nothing. The [This.GetRulerTitle] unleashes his fury, uprooting a few of the monsters with the Force and crushing them. He pours all of his rage into his attacks as the others fall back. At first it seems as if there is a chance but as the battle continues, that optimism fades. There is not a chance they can hold back these creatures using their usual methods.\n\nHowever, the [This.GetRulerTitle] will not yield to these weeds. If they can't be killed, maybe they can be sealed off."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.106.a: "Hold them at bay!"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.107.name: "The Solution"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.107.desc: "The order is given to retreat to the transports and prepare for the possible destruction of the station. With only a handful of warriors and his retinue left, the [This.GetRulerTitle] cancels that order and turns his attention to the statues. Realizing they are used for binding rituals, he focuses his anger on them, calling on his new found power. The plant beast tries to lunge at the [This.GetRulerTitle] but fails. It hisses and bellows, trying to attack with its tendrils, but something is holding it back. It thrashes about as the other statues seemingly activate their binding properties. Soon, the monstrosity is contained.\n\nThe [This.GetRulerTitle] steps back from the statues and turns to his men: §H'Seal off all doors except the one we came through. Disable life support systems to the other wings. Let these disgusting weeds rot here in the station.'§!"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.107.a: "As you wish, my lord."
 lotor_vitiate_quests.201.name: "The Ancient Fortress World of Ziost"
 lotor_vitiate_quests.201.desc: "The colonization of Ziost is a complete success. Ziost holds an important place in the history of the Sith as the capital of the Empire after the Rakata ruined Korriban. Reclaiming the old capital world is a great first step at remaking the Empire and regaining it's past glory."

He is pleased with the news of reclaiming one of our lost worlds, but is growing uneasy about the state of the galaxy. He mentions that if the Sith are to reclaim their dominance, they need to have a powerful leader.\n\nThe [This.GetRulerTitle] seeks more power. He seeks more strength to master the Dark Side and ensure the longevity of his rule. If what we hear is true, then it seems as if the [This.GetRulerTitle] desires to cheat death."

 lotor_vitiate_quests.203.desc: "The Dark Council has conferred with the [This.GetRulerTitle] once more, making sure that they understood him correctly. They would have to perform a ritual that would allow the [This.GetRulerTitle] to siphon energy from all life on Ziost. When successful, the world will be transformed and the [This.GetRulerTitle] will gain even greater power.\n\nAdvisors are worried about the state of the Empire if this is done. The thought of an undying emperor seems appealing but at the same time, it comes at an absurdly high cost. The Empire would ultimately lose one of its most important worlds in an uncertain gambit."

Many of the buildings still have power, making it seem as if there is still life on this world. The somewhat picturesque landscape is now a barren, desolate waste. The clear, blue sky is nothing but dark and grey, reminding some of the team of one of the old bastions in the Unknown Regions.\n\nAccording to the Dark Council, it appears this is only the beginning of the Emperor's pursuit for immortality. It appears that the ritual was a success and the Emperor has gained even more power. Yet, something calls to him. A source of dark side energy that is growing incredibly violent and if left unanswered, could threaten the future of the Sith Empire."
