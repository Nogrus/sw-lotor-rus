 lotor_mando_events.10.desc: "The loss of Mand'alor the Indomitable has thrown the various ruling clans into disarray. The clan leaders see the only way out of this predicament is to expand our territory outwards from Mandalore to claim other worlds, starting with sending an exploratory vessel south to reestablish communications with Onderon. Lasting unity will only be achieved if we can reclaim our symbol of leadership, the mask of our previous Mand'alor."

One of these clan leaders, an upstart warrior named [event_target:mando_concord_dawn_warlord_fleet_leader.GetName], has rallied a significant number of bitter veterans from the last crusade behind their cause, and several damaged battleships have been mustered in orbit over their stronghold at Concord Dawn.

While we know what we must do to unify the great clans, Dxun lies thoroughly in the territory of our enemies, and an expedition will require considerable resources to find and recover the mask, resources that may leave us vulnerable on other fronts."

 lotor_mando_events.230.desc: "During the latter half of the Great Shadow War and our last crusade, Mandalore the Indomitable led an assault on the jungle moon of Onderon, Dxun; it was there where he was separated from his forces and claimed by the vast jungles of the Demon Moon. The Clan Leaders backing the expedition have rallied their full support in recovering his remains and returning them to our homeworld. Should we succeed in finding them, a new Mandalore will be able to rise and reunify our people, ushering them into a new age."

 lotor_mando_events.250.desc: "The expedition has landed on Dxun in a small clearing previously used as a rally point during Mand'alor the Indomitable's invasion. The surrounding jungle is quiet and still, the only movement and sound coming from the rain. It's as if the jungle is holding its breath, waiting to see what happens next."

After what feels like an eternity in the rain, the expedition discovers a crossroads; one path continues into the dense jungle and the never-ending rain, while the other heads towards the safety of a massive cave. The expedition team still hasn't found any evidence of the Mand'alor and must now choose a path forward."
 lotor_mando_events.260.a: "Explore the cave and get out of the rain."
 lotor_mando_events.260.b: "Go deeper into the jungle and hope the rain stops."

 lotor_mando_events.265.name: "Caves"
 lotor_mando_events.265.desc: "The expedition makes a gruesome discovery as they enter the cave; they are immediately assaulted by the overpowering smell of rotten flesh from the piles of bones scattered on the floor. They ready their weapons in case whatever is responsible is still in the cave. Without warning, a Maalraas comes from the jungle and attacks the group. A chorus of howls and footsteps can be heard from deeper within the cave as more Maalraas charge the expedition."
 lotor_mando_events.265.a: "Kill those damn things!"

 lotor_mando_events.270.name: "Jungle"
 lotor_mando_events.270.desc: "The thick jungle canopy provides some much-needed relief from the torrential downpour. While exploring the jungle, the team is startled by the ground suddenly shaking, accompanied by a loud roaring in the distance.\n\nA massive Boma plows through the thicket, instantly crushing some of the group, leaving the survivors to scramble for cover as an ear-splitting screech is heard in response to the sudden commotion. After a few moments of silence, a Drexl crashes through the canopy and attacks the Boma. The ensuing fight lasts for several minutes, with the rest of the expedition hiding in the dense foliage."
 lotor_mando_events.270.a: "An amazing display of strength between predators."

 lotor_mando_events.271.name: "Jungle Discovery"
 lotor_mando_events.271.desc: "As the sounds of the fight dies off, the Drexl screeches and starts eating the Boma, ignoring the hiding expedition. After a few minutes, the Drexl finishes its meal and flies away. The team continues into the jungle, searching under every leaf and rock, hoping to get lucky even though it's becoming increasingly unlikely of finding the Mand'alor's remains, especially with such predators around. After a few hours of searching, nothing turns up until the leader spots something glittering in the light of a distant log."
 lotor_mando_events.271.a: "Could it be...?"

 lotor_mando_events.280.name: "The Ultimate"
 lotor_mando_events.280.desc: "The Taung leader discovers the mask of §YMand'alor the Indomitable§!. The long-lost symbol of leadership has finally been recovered by the Mandalorians.\n\nAs per ancient traditions, he dons the mask and claims his right as the new Mand'alor.\n\nWe can now leave Dxun to begin the new Mand'alor's reign in earnest."

He learns that the ultimate fate of the Taung is extinction, but the traditions and customs that the Taung have lived by will live on long after they're gone.\n\nHis vision continues, showing alien species of the future donning beskar'gam, learning the ways of the clans, and preserving the legacy of the Taung, not as a memorial or tribute but as full-blooded Mandalorians.\n\nThey have given up on their old selves and instead embraced what they could be."

The emissary mentions that he would like the Mand'alor's assistance by accompanying him to Rekkiad and searching the planet for the tomb. Initially, the Mand'alor declines the offer, but his attitude suddenly changes on a whim. He reluctantly accepts the offer and gathers a handful of soldiers to prepare for their departure. The Sith emissary thanks them for their willingness to help and provides coordinates to the planet."

 lotor_mando_events.360.desc: "Rekkiad is a cold, desolate world with towering glaciers and vast mountainous peaks covering the landscape. Despite the bleak surroundings, the weather is surprisingly clear. The Mand'alor arrives and tracks down the Sith's small encampment. The Sith Lord is accompanied by a group of soldiers and archaeologists. They tell Mand'alor that they believe the tomb is situated around a set of massive columns of ice known as the Twin Spears. The Mand'alor examines the map, finding a route mostly clear of steep cliffs and lakes of ice. It will only take a day to reach the Spears based on preliminary observations, provided the weather does not worsen, of course."

Once at the top of the Second Spear, the soldiers and archaeologists, in a rush to get out of the cold and snow, begin haphazardly clearing the layers of ice and snow when suddenly a loud rumbling can be heard.\n\nThe snow begins to slide off the plateau, causing many of the team members to be carried off the edge and fall to their deaths."

The emissary comes forward and turns to his men. Stand guard with the Mandalorians, let no one bother us. They nod knowingly, and the emissary motions for the Mand'alor to follow him. Neither of them is quite sure what to expect down once they hit bottom. The tomb has barely any daylight to guide them back to the surface.\n\nThe emissary ignites his lightsaber, lighting up the dark cave with a bloody red glow. The tomb is mostly empty, yet along one of the cave walls sits a sarcophagus. Upon opening it, the corpse of the Sith Master's rival is revealed. 'Dramath the Second, my master is not quite through with you...' The Mand'alor steps forward and looks into the sarcophagus.

Before we part ways, my Master had a vision and wishes to share it with you. Your people will fight a worthy enemy in the Republic and your battle with them will be remembered forever. World after world will be crushed under the weight of your mighty beskar.'\n\nThe Sith Lord boards his shuttle with his team, leaving the Mand'alor pondering this prophecy."

Or a culture capable of uniting the entire Galaxy? If we limited our recruiting efforts, our people will likely die over generations. By accepting new blood, the Mandalorians will face a new rebirth, one that may stand to benefit the entire Galaxy. Mandalore has already proposed two potential candidates to test this experiment as we prepare for war with the Republic.

 PRELUDE_MANDALORIAN_CRUSADE_DESC: "§YMandalore the Ultimate§! received both a vision and a prophecy in the early days of his rule. The vision he received on Shogun revealed the legacy of the Taung in the form of warriors from various species united together as Mandalorians. His reforms led the clans to grow as they prepared for future battles. But it wasn't until he aided a Sith Lord on Rekkaid that his ambitions grew clearer. The prophecy on Rekkaid, as told by a mysterious Sith emissary, implied that his people would fight an opponent in a war that the galaxy will remember forever. The path forward for our people has been revealed through these premonitions. We will show the Republic and their allies the true strength of our beskar'gam!"
