Видение, которое он получил на Сёгуне, раскрыло наследие таунгов в виде воинов из разных рас, объединённых вместе как мандалорцы. Его реформы привели к тому, что кланы стали разрастаться, готовясь к будущим битвам. Но только когда он помог лорду ситхов на Реккиаде, его амбиции стали яснее. Пророчество о Реккиаде, рассказанное таинственным эмиссаром ситхов, подразумевало, что его люди будут сражаться с противником в войне, которую галактика запомнит навсегда. Через эти предчувствия был открыт путь вперёд для нашего народа. Мы покажем Республике и её союзникам истинную мощь наших бескар'гам!"
