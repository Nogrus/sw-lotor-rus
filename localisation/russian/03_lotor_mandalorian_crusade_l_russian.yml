Millennia from now, the living descendants of our enemies will don beskar'gam and fight for a future Mand'alor."
 lotor_mandalorian_crisis_menu.10.desc.d: "We have begun to take our first steps on the road to Coruscant. This morning some of our strongest bes'uliik riders, led by Cassus Fett, landed on top of the aloriya that once belonged to the Cathar people. At the same time, our cruisers obliterated any other resistance centers thy could have organized from the opposite side of the planet.\nIn the smoldering ruins of Cathar, signs of a glorious rebirth can already be seen. The survivors of their kind will have no choice but to serve Mand'alor as we turn our gaze to the south.\nThere can be no doubt that this pathetic battle has done nothing to sate our lust for war."
 lotor_mandalorian_crisis_menu.10.desc.e: "I am Cassus Fett and today I have a message for any who still doubt Mandalore the Ultimate. We have taken the planet of Taris through fire and blood. No longer can the core worlds offer you safety, no longer can they claim ignorance to the dangers we pose! Those who wish to join the Mando'ade in our crusade for the galaxy are welcome. Helmet and armor will be yours—and the way of the warrior will be made known to you. All you must do is rise up against the ge'hutuunse pretending to keep you safe. Taris is but a stepping stone in the path to take what is rightfully our! Coruscant will learn to bend to our might. For Mand'alor!"

 lotor_mandalorian_crisis_menu.100.desc: "We're not huddled in one place, our ideals span the galaxy. We can live without technology, so we will fight with our bare hands if need be. We have no species or bloodline, so as long as someone follows our creed of honor through battle, they may join us."

 lotor_mandalorian_crisis_menu.100.a: "What is the Mandalorian Crusade and its Purpose?"
 lotor_mandalorian_crisis_menu.100.a.response: "For too long our people have suffered under §YMandalore the Indomitable§!'s humiliating defeat on the moon of Dxun. Guided by visions, §YMandalore the Ultimate§! has seen the path forward to glory. His new vision of society is one where warriors will rule and be supported by farmers, artisans, and manufacturers who accept the Mandalorian way. We must look beyond the Taung if our empire is to flourish."

 lotor_mandalorian_crisis_menu.100.b: "What happened in the Past?"
 lotor_mandalorian_crisis_menu.100.b.response: "The first Mandalorian Crusaders fought under §YMandalore the Indomitable§! during the Great Sith War many years ago. The bloody campaigns waged by the Taung have served as the first significant expression of the Mandalorian people on the galactic stage. Unfortunately, the sheer number of opponents against us proved too great and the visions experienced by the Mand'alor on the mysterious world of Shogun proved to be nothing more than ramblings of a false prophet. The hundreds of broken Bes'uliiks scattered across the surface of Onderon serve as a reminder of our humiliation. However, we are convinced §YMandalore the Ultimate§! will show us the way to glory!"

 lotor_mandalorian_crisis_menu.100.c: "Who is our Mand'alor and why is he Important?"
 lotor_mandalorian_crisis_menu.100.c.response: "While searching for the remains of §YMandalore the Indomitable§! on the moon of Dxun, it is said a Taung warrior found the previous leaders mask. The Mask of the §HMand'alor§! was first worn by the Taung warrior §YMand'alor the First§!, carved from the rigid bone of a mythosaur's sternum, and modeled after the facial features of the Taung species. In time, the fabled helm has become the symbol of leadership among our vode. It was passed down through the ages to those Mandalorians who proved themselves worthy of the title of §HMand'alor§!, leader of the Mandalorian clans. As a result of his discovery, §YMandalore the Ultimate§! now has the responsibility of leading our people to victory!"

 lotor_mandalorian_crisis_menu.200.desc: "As leader of all Mandalorians it is my responsibility to make sure I lead our vode into a glorious new future! Conquering planets, converting alien populations to the way, and defeating mighty foes will go a long way in achieving glory to our people. This is the way!"

 lotor_mandalorian_crisis_menu.200.a: "The Conquest of Cathar"
 lotor_mandalorian_crisis_menu.200.a.response: "Our akaan'ade is inexperienced. The primitive world of Cathar to the northwest of our empire will serve as an excellent training ground for our recruits. Since the people of Cathar already embrace their militarism, conquering them shall allow us to raise new fleets if necessary.\n\n§HNote§!: A hyperlane will be created from one of our systems to §YCathar§!.\nIf we don't control any of the adjacent systems, the hyperlane will be created after we do.\n\nExpect a lag-spike while the hyperlane gets created."

The people of Taris to the west of our empire are a properly modernized empire with an effective military.
