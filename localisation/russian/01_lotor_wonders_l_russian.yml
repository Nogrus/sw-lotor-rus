 lotor_wonders.10.desc: "The people of [Root.GetName] want to rebuild the great §MShawken Spire§!! They think it will be a sign of unity for our empire and possibly the whole galaxy. It will take a tremendous effort and time from our best engineers but it is possible. When finished it will reach low-orbit altitude and be the tallest structure known to us. The engineers will try to keep the spire as historical accurate as possible but without any surviving documents of its construction thousands of years ago this will be difficult. A finished spire will bring large amounts of tourists to the planet and our empire and increase our trade value!"

The archive also starts to attract a lot of people and scientist from other parts of the galaxy to learn and research as well as to share their knowledge."

Now the scientists go into the second phase of mainly focusing on the preserving and researching of the knowledge.
