 approach_lotor_sith_massassi_a_desc: "§HMassassi§! are powerful creatures. We can use them as gladiators and make them pull oversized loads like carriages. This will provide us some buffs but it will slowly anger the §HMassassi§!." #NT!

 lotor_yavin_events.1.desc: "Emperor, we have landed on the jungle moon of §Y[This.GetName]§! and have established a small settlement. This world is teeming with life and dark side energy. The legacy of §RNaga Sadow§!, §RFreedon Nadd§!, and §RExar Kun§! is tied to this world. And if what we believe is true, our wayward kin are still here as well." #NT!

 lotor_yavin_events.3.desc: "On §YKorriban§!, the §YMassassi§! were some of our finest warriors but due to §RNaga Sadow's§! meddling, they've become nothing but monstrous brutes.

 lotor_yavin_events.5.desc: "Our ongoing rapport with our §YMassassi§! kin is improving. We've learned much about §RSadow's§! cruelty towards them and §RKun's§! desperate attempt to survive the Jedi attack. We've offered the §YMassassi§! a place within our rising empire if they are willing to submit to us. Their distrust is justified but having our strongest warriors reunited with the Empire would bolster our ranks." #NT!

 lotor_yavin_events.6.desc: "Our talks have succeeded with the §YMassassi§! tribes. The chieftains have agreed to serve the §RSith Empire§! once more. While they aren't capable of commanding military forces or rule in the civilian sector, their presence alone is enough to instill fear in our enemies and those of us who wish to go against our §REmperor's§! wishes.\n\nIt won't be long now before both §YKissai§! and §YMassassi§! return to §YKorriban§! and repair the damage wrought by the Jedi and Republic." #NT!
