 lotor_sith_empire.1000.desc: "The recolonization of Kalsunor is a great success for the Empire. However, there is one slight snag, years ago some of our brightest minds saw the potential in a type of beetle that lived on this world. No larger than a womp rat, Sith Alchemy enhanced these creatures turning them into weapons. Their descendants apparently still inhabit this world. Given the right instructions under a talented Sith Sorcerer, we could try to domesticate these chittering monstrosities for future campaigns."
