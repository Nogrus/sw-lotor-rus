# Ryloth Gulag Bloom
 lotor_ryloth_events.10.name: "The Visitors"
 lotor_ryloth_events.10.desc: "An off-world cargo ship has arrived today ready to receive its shipment for the Duro colony on §YNeimoidia§!. The crew is very professional, a nice change of pace compared to the unscrupulous slavers and criminals that are frequent visitors to Ryloth. In addition to credits, they've also paid our dockworkers with fruit from another of their colonies. The crew comment that the mottled texture on the fruit is nothing to worry about."
 lotor_ryloth_events.10.a: "An odd but pleasant surprise."

 lotor_ryloth_events.20.name: "The Fungus"
 lotor_ryloth_events.20.desc: "One of our scientists has noticed that some of our trees are being slowly afflicted with a strange fungus. While it seems mostly benign, the larger scientific community encourages that we monitor this strange occurrence."
 lotor_ryloth_events.20.a: "Very well, lets gather some samples and study them."

 lotor_ryloth_events.30.name: "A Devastated World"
 lotor_ryloth_events.30.desc: "Despite our best efforts, the fungus has spread out of control. Ryloth's forests may never fully recover. However, authorities apprehended the crew of the Duro ship when they arrived. In the future, we may be able to fully restore Ryloth's forests but for now, our forests will give way to rocky, barren environments."
 lotor_ryloth_events.30.a: "For now, the forests will be just a memory."

 GUGAL_BLOOM_INVESTIGATION_PROJECT: "Invasive Spores"
 GUGAL_BLOOM_INVESTIGATION_PROJECT_DESC: "Our scientists are alarmed at the rapid spread of this invasive fungus. The initial observations of it being benign are called into question as they notice that trees afflicted with this fungus are dying at a rapid rate. Furthermore, the spread of this fungus could potentially devastate the forests on Ryloth beyond repair."

 GUGAL_BLOOM_TRACKING_PROJECT: "The Culprits"
 GUGAL_BLOOM_TRACKING_PROJECT_DESC: "The investigation points towards the dockworkers handling the Duro shipment. Upon interrogation, its revealed that the Duro crew offered the dockworkers some fruit in addition to their pay. After the Duros left, the workers tried the fruit and immediately tossed it out, claiming it was unpleasant and quite possibly rotten.The Duros are due back in a few rotations for their next shipment."


# Alderaan Joiners
 r_killik_eggs: "Killik Eggsack"
 r_killik_eggs_desc: "New Killiks can be born through these eggsacks. Making a new hive means more Joiners to increase relations with the hive."

 leader_trait_lotor_killik_joiner: "Killik Joiner"
 leader_trait_lotor_killik_joiner_desc: "Joiners - or pejoratively bughugger and other slurs - was the name given to the non-Killiks who were absorbed into the Killik hive mind. This was caused by being exposed to the large amounts of pheromones that the Killiks secreted that changed a person's brain structure."

 lotor_alderaan_events.10.name: "The Monuments"
 lotor_alderaan_events.10.desc: "Alderaan's natural beauty is beyond comparison. Our forests, mountains, grasslands, and other features stand out among all of the Core Worlds, possibly among the rest of the galaxy. However, our planet is still not without mystery.\n\nThere are numerous spires scattered across the landscape. Our scientists and historians want to examine these structures in depth to figure out who or what constructed these elaborate 'towers'."
 lotor_alderaan_events.10.a: "Very well."
 lotor_alderaan_events.10.b: "Ensure our scientists are well equipped."

 lotor_alderaan_events.20.name: "The Castle Lands"
 lotor_alderaan_events.20.desc: "A great deal of information has been gathered from the many teams sent around the planet. The few teams who journeyed into these spires commented on how much they resemble the interior of insect hives yet were decorated with colorful mosaics.\n\nMultiple scientists report that they've felt calm around these massive constructs, and historians have noted that whatever empire and species made these 'castles' suffered a decline. Yet all the field notes expressed a reoccurring sentiment - reverence."
 lotor_alderaan_events.20.a: "We too could vanish if we are not careful..."

 lotor_alderaan_events.30.name: "Empty Nest"
 lotor_alderaan_events.30.desc: "The mystery surrounding the earthen castles continues to confound our historians and scientists. Further examinations into their structure show that the species originally living here were insectoids of some variety. One scientist noted a chamber with large holes in the walls made for eggs."
 lotor_alderaan_events.30.a: "Fascinating!"

 lotor_alderaan_events.40.name: "Rumors"
 lotor_alderaan_events.40.desc: "There are multiple rumors surrounding a strange mound in the middle of a settlement. The original settlers built around the structure due to its unique beauty and have lived normal, peaceful lives ever since.\n\nRecently, people claim they've been hearing scratching in their homes and strange smells. Others have heard clicking and chittering late at night near the mound. An even smaller amount reported headaches and nausea whenever they heard the noises.\n\nAdditionally, reports from other parts of the planet describe creatures coming out of these mounds every few years and coming into conflict with the Alderaanians."
 lotor_alderaan_events.40.a: "Send a small team to investigate."
 lotor_alderaan_events.40.b: "Send a large team to investigate."
 lotor_alderaan_events.40.c: "Nonsense!"

 lotor_alderaan_events.50.name: "Survey"
 lotor_alderaan_events.50.desc: "The team arrives and assists the local doctors as others start examining the mound and the surrounding buildings. The lead scientist asks around for the local mayor, but no one has seen him in a few days.\n\nAs the sun sets, some scientists also report the chittering rounds in some structures closest to the spire. A group of scientists enters the settlement's main government building and heads to the basement. A small astromech rolls past them, frantically beeping and trying to make the scientists turn around."
 lotor_alderaan_events.50.a: "Proceed with caution."
 lotor_alderaan_events.50.b: "Ignore the little droid."

 lotor_alderaan_events.60.name: "The Neighbors"
 lotor_alderaan_events.60.desc: "The lighting inside the basement is minimal at best. The faint hum of machinery is there, but the chittering and scratching noises are noticeably louder. Despite the urging of the little droid, the team moves forward and discovers a large hole in the ground with a faint, blueish light leading deeper.\n\nThey carefully follow the path until they reach a cavern lit up by bioluminescent fungi. The light from the fungi reveals tall, insectoid bodies moving around, tending to the clutches of eggs on the wall as what can only be assumed as their larvae feasting nearby.\n\nA lone grub crawls on the astromech, making the droid panic, alerting the entire hive to the team's presence."
 lotor_alderaan_events.60.a: "Blasted droid!"

 lotor_alderaan_events.70.name: "Rumors"
 lotor_alderaan_events.70.desc: "The drones tending to the egg move into position to protect them as the warrior drones surround the team, spears and rudimentary blasters drawn. A human steps forth from among them, and they lower their weapons. The man extends his hand to the lead scientist.\n'I'm the local mayor; it was only a matter of time, I suppose, before you'd meet the neighbors. Several days ago, these insects burrowed into the basement, looking to expand their hive. Not wanting to alarm the populace, I decided to go and investigate myself, only to be captured by the drones. §YThe Kind§! wishes to seek a peaceful existence between Alderaanian and Killik. They are not used to being disturbed by so many people at once.'\n\nThe scientist notices something peculiar about the man. He seemed a bit more rigid than one would expect, but his black eyes were the most glaring thing about his appearance."
 lotor_alderaan_events.70.a: "Absolutely! There will be peace in our time."
 lotor_alderaan_events.70.b: "We will see what we can do."
 lotor_alderaan_events.70.c: "Try and convince them not to hatch."

 lotor_alderaan_events.80.name: "Discovery"
 lotor_alderaan_events.80.desc: "The mayor smiles and nods. 'We aren't the only hive around here, and in fact, several of the Kind are stirring underneath our cities and towns. Do not worry; I will reveal the existence of our hive to the town. Now go, return to your fellow scientists. I will be up shortly.' The mayor orders the Killik to escort the scientists out of the tunnels and back to the surface.\n\nHours later, the mayor returns to the town square and informs the populace of the existence of the Killiks underneath their town and throughout the planet.\nWhether this was a good decision or not is yet to be seen."
 lotor_alderaan_events.80.a: "Who knows what might come of this?"

 lotor_alderaan_events.81.name: "Discovery"
 lotor_alderaan_events.81.desc: "The mayor grimaces and motions to the clutches of eggs adorning the room. Drones continue to attend to the eggs as they hatch and watch the grubs crawl about the cavern floor. 'It is a bit too late for that now. The Kind continues.'\n\nHours later, the mayor returns to the town square and informs the populace of the existence of the Killiks underneath their town and throughout the planet. Whether this was a good decision or not is yet to be seen."
 lotor_alderaan_events.81.a: "Who knows what may come of this?"

 lotor_alderaan_events.82.name: "Discovery"
 lotor_alderaan_events.82.desc: "Despite being brushed off as rumors, it appears the afflictions of the citizenry around the spire are based in reality. In fact, the truth is far more incredible than the rumors. The mayor has been missing for a few days but only recently returned, describing his encounter with tall insectoid creatures called the Killik.\n\nAccording to the report, these creatures are now waking up slowly. They are quite possibly the source of rumors about monsters and the strange chittering and scratching noises."
 lotor_alderaan_events.82.a: "Fascinating."

 lotor_alderaan_events.90.name: "Growing Doubt"
 lotor_alderaan_events.90.desc: "With news of the Killik's presence on Alderaan spreading throughout Alderaanian space, some members of the §YGreat Houses§! seek a peaceful relationship while others remain skeptical.\nHowever, some are opposed to any relationship with the Killik. They recall the times they've attacked villages, leaving them destroyed with no survivors. Recently, a small settlement was raided within the jurisdiction of House Thul."
 lotor_alderaan_events.90.a: "Only time will tell what these relations might bring."

 lotor_alderaan_events.100.name: "Reaching Out"
 lotor_alderaan_events.100.desc: "In an attempt to foster a relationship between the Killik and Alderaan, a small team of diplomats is sent to a hive, escorted by some members of House Thul. They intend to camp near one of the more active hives and attempt to communicate with the Killik. If it weren't for the diplomats, it'd appear as if a small strike force was being prepared."
 lotor_alderaan_events.100.a: "Nothing to see, move along."
 lotor_alderaan_events.100.b: "Examine the cargo."

 lotor_alderaan_events.101.name: "Uncovered"
 lotor_alderaan_events.101.desc: "Days later, the repulsorcraft returned with significantly fewer people. Although they never quite said what happened, it was clear that the mission failed terribly. Eventually, it was revealed that the diplomats acted as a cover for members of House Thul and Ulgo to destroy an emerging hive."
 lotor_alderaan_events.101.a: "Blasted bugs!"

 lotor_alderaan_events.102.name: "Uncovered"
 lotor_alderaan_events.102.desc: "Despite reassurances from the diplomats that they only brought the essentials, local authorities examine the cargo loaded onto the repulsorcraft. After a few minutes of examining the crates, they discover explosive charges hidden beneath essential supplies.\n\nWhen asked about the explosives; the diplomats feigned ignorance."
 lotor_alderaan_events.102.a: "Remove the diplomats from their posts!"

 lotor_alderaan_events.110.name: "Devastation"
 lotor_alderaan_events.110.desc: "One of the major farming settlements along the Apalis Coast was razed by a particularly war-like hive of Killiks. The leader of House Organa is both enraged and devastated by the loss of life and the destruction of a bountiful harvest."
 lotor_alderaan_events.110.a: "Send for aid from the other houses."
 lotor_alderaan_events.110.b: "Seek a military response."

 lotor_alderaan_events.111.name: "Responses"
 lotor_alderaan_events.111.desc: "Over the next few days, support comes from §HHouse Panteer§! and §HHouse Rist§!. Supplies, food, and medical aid are given to the survivors as members of the House Guard examine the devastated farmland. It appears as if some citizens were captured and their fate unknown.\n\nWhile investigating, they encounter a few members of a group known as the §ROrder of Extermination§!. Having taken it upon themselves to fight back against Killik attacks whenever they emerge, they offer their support to House Organa, despite rejecting any loyalty to any of the §YGreat Houses§!."
 lotor_alderaan_events.111.a: "Vigilantes? We have no use for their kind.."

 lotor_alderaan_events.112.name: "Responses"
 lotor_alderaan_events.112.desc: "Members of the House Guard aid in recovery efforts and learn that at least a few citizens were captured. However, their fate is unknown. As military leaders from §HHouse Organa§! deliberate, they are approached by a captain of a group called the §ROrder of Extermination§!.\nHaving taken it upon themselves to fight against the Killiks whenever their hives emerge and attack settlements, they offer their support to House Organa, despite rejecting loyalty to any of the §YGreat Houses§!."
 lotor_alderaan_events.112.a: "Perhaps this order will be useful."

 lotor_alderaan_events.113.name: "Vigilance"
 lotor_alderaan_events.113.desc: "Despite the offer from the Order, the leaders of §HHouse Organa§! turn down their direct support. They argue that the conflicts with the Killik will be ongoing and that orchestrating a large-scale attack would put more lives at risk. The head of §HHouse Organa§! orders a small detachment of the House Guard to monitor the area in case the Killik return or the captives turn up."
 lotor_alderaan_events.113.a: "Keep watch."

 lotor_alderaan_events.114.name: "Striking Back"
 lotor_alderaan_events.114.desc: "The §ROrder§! offers to take full charge of this mission, refusing §HHouse Organa§! or any other house to supply their forces. A concerned officer in the House Guard asks about the captives. The §ROrder§! captain grimaces and ignores the question.\n\nWith a sizeable force, the §ROrder§! rallies near the desolate village and finds the entrance to this hive inside a farmhouse. The foundation crumbled and revealed a massive network of tunnels leading to different parts of the hive. The captain signals his men to ready their blasters and flamethrowers as they near a chamber with the loudest buzzing."
 lotor_alderaan_events.114.a: "Very well."

 lotor_alderaan_events.115.name: "The Stranger"
 lotor_alderaan_events.115.desc: "Some time passes, and the settlement ruins are left behind and blocked off. One evening, a human emerges from one of the farmhouses with minimal injuries. A guardsman sees them and brings them into town, where they are checked over. Aside from the peculiar black eyes, they seem otherwise healthy. The lone human claims they are a scientist and is seeking to start their career a new in the service of Alderaan's interests."
 lotor_alderaan_events.115.a: "Bring them aboard. Give them a new lease on life."

 lotor_alderaan_events.116.name: "House Warming"
 lotor_alderaan_events.116.desc: "The soldiers enter the chamber and begin to open fire with their blasters and flamethrowers; within seconds, the chamber is set ablaze as the worker drones panic and are set aflame while the warriors rush into the fray only to be cut down by blaster fire. Some of the §ROrders'§! soldiers are knocked down by some of the larger warriors who weren't immediately dispatched; nearby soldiers quickly execute the warriors. The fighting continues as the Order pushes deeper into the hive, destroying eggs and grubs as they go.\nAmidst the battle, the captives are spotted. The captain and a few of his men rush to them and quickly examine them. Their eyes are black, and they seem to have been assimilated into the §YKind§!."
 lotor_alderaan_events.116.a: "There is no hope for them."

 lotor_alderaan_events.117.name: "Aftermath"
 lotor_alderaan_events.117.desc: "The order is given, and one of the soldiers turns their flamethrowers to the captives. For a brief moment, their humanity comes through as they plead, but within seconds they are silenced. The §ROrder§! continues to push through the hive until every last grub and egg is destroyed.\n\nAs the sun rises, the Order emerges victorious and is greeted with cheers and applause from the settlement's original inhabitants. A panicked group of citizens asks them the whereabouts of the captives. The captain grimaces and explains that they put the captives out of their misery."
 lotor_alderaan_events.117.a: "Nothing down there but bugs and bughuggers."

 lotor_alderaan_events.120.name: "Strange Conditions"
 lotor_alderaan_events.120.desc: "There are growing reports of humans with black eyes spotted in settlements that had recently come in contact with the Killiks. The reports also mention that while some retain their personality and mannerisms, others seem more drawn to the hives."
 lotor_alderaan_events.120.a: "A worrying development."

 lotor_alderaan_events.121.name: "Unforeseen Consequences"
 lotor_alderaan_events.121.desc: "Reports have reached the Alderaanian capital about the destruction of a settlement and hive near the Apalis Coast. According to some civilians, members of the Order of Extermination killed some captives of the Killiks during the fighting.\n\nThe §ROrder§! claims the captives had their minds subsumed by the Killiks, having joined their hivemind. The families of the deceased claimed they should have been spared and brought back for treatment."
 lotor_alderaan_events.121.a: "Side with the §ROrder§!."
 lotor_alderaan_events.121.b: "Side with the families."

 lotor_alderaan_events.122.name: "Unforeseen Consequences"
 lotor_alderaan_events.122.desc: "Reports have reached the Alderaanian capital of the destruction of a settlement near the Apalis Coast. According to §HOrgana§! guardsmen, a lone survivor of the attack came out of the rubble days after the attack. They claim he was acting peculiar and had black eyes.\nThis matches the report from scientists earlier about a mayor who had been taken into a hive and returned with similar abnormalities."
 lotor_alderaan_events.122.a: "We should monitor this closely."

 lotor_alderaan_events.130.name: "Alarming News"
 lotor_alderaan_events.130.desc: "Leaders of the Great Houses are growing increasingly alarmed with the news that more people are showing up with this affliction. Local doctors and scientists have started to refer to these people as '§HJoiners§!.'"
 lotor_alderaan_events.130.a: "A worrying development."

 lotor_alderaan_events.140.name: "Bug Problems"
 lotor_alderaan_events.140.desc: "The Alderaanian Joiners struggle to adapt to life with humans and serve the hiveminds. They say that their relationship with the Killik hiveminds is symbiotic, allowing for a greater connection than possibly the insects themselves.\n\nThis sentiment has disturbed many people, leading scientists to examine the §HJoiner's§! conditions and what causes the subsuming process; however, volunteers are needed, and few would want to participate willingly."
 lotor_alderaan_events.140.a: "Offer some compensation for tests."
 lotor_alderaan_events.140.b: "Acquire subjects through other means."

 lotor_alderaan_events.150.name: "New Subjects"
 lotor_alderaan_events.150.desc: "With subjects acquired, scientists start questioning and testing to understand the exact relationship between the §HJoiners§! and the hive. The questioning helps determine which hives have more §HJoiner§! activity and their connection to the hives. The testing is relatively standard, determining if there is any reasonably prominent biological connection.\nThe scientists and doctors can proceed with this line of examination, or they can approach it in a more invasive and far more dangerous way."
 lotor_alderaan_events.150.a: "Proceed as normal, no need to cause harm to the subjects."
 lotor_alderaan_events.150.b: "An in depth examination is absolutely required."

 lotor_alderaan_events.151.name: "Initial Findings"
 lotor_alderaan_events.151.desc: "The observation and questioning continue as expected as more information comes in from doctors and scientists across Alderaan. Based on non-invasive scans, it appears as if the §HJoiners§! were exposed to pheromones which started a transformation of their corpus callosum. The transformation allows them to receive signal impulses from the Killiks themselves."
 lotor_alderaan_events.151.a: "Fascinating!"

 lotor_alderaan_events.152.name: "Initial Findings"
 lotor_alderaan_events.152.desc: "Despite the subjects' pleas, the scientists and doctors begin doing invasive examinations of the patients. A thorough physical reveals that their physiology remains unchanged. However, when exposed to different heat and magnetic auras, their brain activity changes rapidly."
 lotor_alderaan_events.152.a: "Do more intensive brain studies."
 lotor_alderaan_events.152.b: "Push the limits of brain examination."

 lotor_alderaan_events.153.name: "Joining"
 lotor_alderaan_events.153.desc: "Additional questioning reveals that if a hive consumes a large enough population, they will adopt some of their mannerisms and traits. This worrying news is followed up with learning that it is possible to reverse the §GJoining§! process medically; however, it is a dangerous procedure that most would refuse to participate in."
 lotor_alderaan_events.153.a: "Perhaps some can be saved if stopped early enough..."

 lotor_alderaan_events.154.name: "Further Studies"
 lotor_alderaan_events.154.desc: "The examinations continue as scientists pour over the constant influx of new data. A sample of some plant matter around one of the hives sparked some brain activity, indicating that pheromones also cause a reaction in §HJoiners§!. At the same time, when exposed to chanmasu herbs provided by some Order soldiers, their bodies recoiled.\n\nAdditional scans show that the §Gjoining§! process transformed their brains, specifically the corpus callosum. This accounts for the unique responses to different auras."
 lotor_alderaan_events.154.a: "Very odd..."

 lotor_alderaan_events.155.name: "Further Studies"
 lotor_alderaan_events.155.desc: "Constant exposure to different auras puts a tremendous physical strain on a §HJoiner's§! body and mind. Before long, some of the subjects drop dead. Their autopsies reveal a transformed corpus callosum, no doubt a side effect of the §Gjoining§! process."
 lotor_alderaan_events.155.a: "A mind is a terrible thing to waste."

 lotor_alderaan_events.156.name: "Understanding Joiners"
 lotor_alderaan_events.156.desc: "When asked why they allowed themselves to become §HJoiners§!, they stated it was never intentional. Coming in contact with the pheromones and other auras was by no means planned, yet their joining with the §YHive§! has benefited them greatly. Some mention that they will ultimately become one with their respective hives.\nWith the questioning and testing concluding, it becomes clear to the Alderaanians that the §HJoiners§! are just one part of a complex web of interactions between themselves and the Killik. The §HJoiners§! are sent back to their respective homes from the testing sites."
 lotor_alderaan_events.156.a: "The §YGreat Houses§! should be informed of our discoveries."

 lotor_alderaan_events.157.name: "Dismissed"
 lotor_alderaan_events.157.desc: "The subjects who survived the brain studies are questioned afterward about how they became part of the hive. The §HJoiners§! say that their connection to their hives was not intentional, a mere side effect of being exposed to large amounts of pheromones.\nAs far as the §Gjoining§! process goes, asking if it was possible to disconnect someone from the hives, the §HJoiners§! respond hesitantly. According to them, it's possible but at significant risk to the individual. Not to mention the unwillingness of those who have become subsumed by the hives."
 lotor_alderaan_events.157.a: "These findings will be most useful."

 lotor_alderaan_events.158.name: "Final Results"
 lotor_alderaan_events.158.desc: "With the §HJoiners§! compensated and sent back to their respective homes, the scientists meet with the leaders of the §YGreat Houses§!. Many leaders are pleased with the simple fact that §HJoiners§! can be disconnected. However, with so few §HJoiners§! present in the Alderaanian population, there is no need to immediately seek a way to reverse the process.\n\nAt the same time, military leaders find it fascinating that pheromones and certain auras can cause an adverse reaction in the Killiks. There are still lingering questions about the Killiks, especially with the abandoned hives in the Castle Lands."
 lotor_alderaan_events.158.a: "The galaxy is vast and mysterious."

 lotor_alderaan_events.159.name: "Final Results"
 lotor_alderaan_events.159.desc: "The §HJoiners§! are sent back to their homes from the various testing sites, and the findings are sent to the leaders of the §YGreat Houses§!. The findings from the multiple scientists are well received, and the observations about reactions to auras, pheromones, and certain plants catch the interest of the military leaders, especially those from §HHouse Ulgo§! and §HHouse Thul§!.\n\nThere are still lingering questions about the Killiks, especially with the abandoned hives in the Castle Lands. The longer Alderaanians interact with the Killiks, the more information is gathered."
 lotor_alderaan_events.159.a: "Surely our studies today will not have repercussions."

 lotor_alderaan_events.160.name: "An Ongoing Mystery"
 lotor_alderaan_events.160.desc: "A group of scientists and historians have poured over all the findings from the recent interactions with the Killiks and §HJoiners§!. It became clear that the Killiks once swelled in numbers on Alderaan, but something occurred, leading to a rapid decline.\n\nReviewing the findings might reveal some information that was passed over. Alternatively, a small team of archaeologists and historians can be sent to the Castle Lands to examine one of the many hives."
 lotor_alderaan_events.160.a: "Continue reviewing notes."
 lotor_alderaan_events.160.b: "Send a small team to the Castle Lands for more information."

 lotor_alderaan_events.161.name: "Continued Studies"
 lotor_alderaan_events.161.desc: "Each report on the §HJoiners§! initially revealed very little new information. However, some of the §HJoiners§! made passing remarks about 'lost hives' and an event called the '§BGreat Migration§!' in the Killik's past."
 lotor_alderaan_events.161.a: "Interesting..."

 lotor_alderaan_events.162.name: "Continued Studies"
 lotor_alderaan_events.162.desc: "The team arrives at the Castle Lands and starts exploring one of the central spires. The eerie silence inside the earthen structure is surprisingly calming. Descending into the egg chamber, the archaeologists look over the numerous mosaics fashioned out of stones and pebbles.\n\nThe team is caught off guard by noticing a Joiner being escorted by two drones. The §HJoiner§! introduces themselves as §HDawn Herald§! - an emissary for one of the hives. She explains that she is here to learn of the '§BGreat Migration§!.'"
 lotor_alderaan_events.162.a: "By all means, tell us more."

 lotor_alderaan_events.163.name: "But Where?"
 lotor_alderaan_events.163.desc: "The §HJoiners§! make vague references to one of the largest Killik hives departing Alderaan. Since they could not find a world that could handle their numbers, the largest hive separated, pursuing other planets independently.\n\nThis revelation is fascinating yet slightly concerning. Perhaps it is possible to find another world they've settled on."
 lotor_alderaan_events.163.a: "Who knows where they could be?"

 lotor_alderaan_events.164.name: "But Where?"
 lotor_alderaan_events.164.desc: "According to the §HDawn Herald§!, the Great Migration was an event far in the Killik's past, before the Republic was even formed. They left Alderaan searching for a new home, but when they could not find a world that would hold their numbers, the largest hive split up to pursue their own paths.\n\nThis means the Killiks are also present on other planets, a surprising yet slightly concerning revelation. The §HJoiner§! continues to speak with the archaeologists before they part ways and return with their findings."
 lotor_alderaan_events.164.a: "Let's report the findings and see where we can go from there."

 lotor_alderaan_events.170.name: "Concerns"
 lotor_alderaan_events.170.desc: "The possibility that the Killiks spread to other worlds is alarming to most §YHouses§!. A few scientists started surveying neighboring Core World systems in response to this news. Their study shows that one world, §YAlsakan§!, had a Killik presence on it.\n\nLeaders from §HHouse Alde§! suggest going to §YAlsakan§! and meeting with a prominent historian. Their insights can help with possibly locating the new homeworld of the Killik."
 lotor_alderaan_events.170.a: "§YAlsakan§!? What a curious place."

 lotor_alderaan_events.180.name: "Crossroads"
 lotor_alderaan_events.180.desc: "The meeting with the Alsakan historian was insightful. The Killiks left mounds on §YAlsakan§! similar to those found in the Castle Lands. They are also dated back to before the §GRepublic§!. When asked about the potential location of a new §YKillik homeworld§!, the historian brought up a star chart. Albeit dated, they suggested that the Killik's new homeworld could be somewhere in the vast §BUnknown Regions§!.\n\nWhen the team returned to Alderaan, they faced a choice. Either pursue a potentially dangerous path of discovery with finding the new Killik homeworld or not."
