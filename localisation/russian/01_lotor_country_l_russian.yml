# Starting Texts

 START_SCREEN_CORUSCANT: "No expectation is set too high for the people of §YCoruscant§!!\n\nThe rebuilt city of Zhell is truly a sight to behold. A crowning achievement of all things in beauty, architecture, and efficiency. As grand and noble as the city is, it is only a façade. Without others following our lead of Democracy, how could they ever grow to be as grand as we?\n\nDuring the reign of the §HInfinite Empire§!, our people sent out sleeper ships, secretly colonizing planets under §HRakatan's§! eyes. With those despots gone, we must seek out our long-lost brothers and sisters. We must reunite under one banner, it is the only way we can be strong and prosper."

 START_SCREEN_ALDERAAN: "Of all the core worlds, §YAlderaan§! is unmatched in its beauty. Human settlement on this unspoiled world is still an ongoing venture and brings with it new challenges. As descendants of human colonists from the §YHerglic Trade Empire§!, our people lived at peace with nature and each other. This harmony allows ten families to grow in power and prestige as §YAlderaan§! continues to expand its influence.\n\nHowever, the §YGreat Houses§! are not the first families on this planet and we are merely in the shadow of an older empire. Among the picturesque landscape are petrified spires belonging to an ancient race that has seemingly vanished from §YAlderaan§!.\n\nWe must not go the way of this lost empire and §YAlderaan§! must endure. The leadership of the §YGreat Houses§! and our brilliant scientists and engineers will see that our people can survive peacefully in this ever expanding galaxy."

 START_SCREEN_CORELLIA: "We are the sons and daughters of former slaves, held in bondage by the §HInfinite Empire§!. Our ancestors toiled at length to construct a machine that could harness energy from suns and produce fleets of immense size. But as the §HBuilders§! fell, we seized the opportunity and revolted.\n\nSince then, we have reverse engineered their machines and mastered hyperspace travel. Our insights brought us closer together and eventually, others in the galaxy as well. We've charted new planets, fostered a closer bond with §YSelonian§! and §YDrall§!, and continue to explore the §BCore§!.\n\n§YCorellia's§! future is bright and we will pursue a better future for our people as our galaxy expands."

 START_SCREEN_DURO: "Our people are former slaves turned explorers, reverse engineering the machinery of the §HBuilders§! and using it to explore the Galaxy. Our understanding of hyperspace travel allows us to expand trade and forge alliances with our neighbors, some of which joined us in rebelling against the §HBuilders§!.\n\nDue to our engineering prowess, the §YDuros§! have a bright future ahead. Our leaders see the galaxy as full of opportunity for our people."

 START_SCREEN_ALSAKAN: "The northern portion of the §BCore§! took the brunt of the chaos of the §HGreat Hyperspace War§!. The §YAlsakan's§! stood by with the §BCore§! to defend the galaxy from the §HSith§! expecting rewards beyond our wildest dreams. Unfortunately, the people of §YCoruscant§! have decided they'd much rather restore their own planet rather than pay their debts to us. We were one of §YCoruscant's§! first colonies only to now be abandoned in our time of need.\n\nIn this time of great change the §BMid Rim§! to our north is shaping up to be a dangerous place to live. The sparks left behind from §HMandalore the Indomitable's§! great crusade could threaten to turn into an inferno once again if not dealt with appropriately. If we are going to maintain our extravagant lifestyle, we will need the backing of the §BCore§!. Whether it's by joining the coalition rumored to be forming there or conquering §YCoruscant§! for its natural resources."

 START_SCREEN_CZERKA_CORPORATION: "Greetings §YPresident Seario§!, the board of §YCzerka Corporation§! congratulates you on your most prestigious promotion.\n\nHowever, there are concerns you may not share the same interests as they do. You must forgo any morals, compassion, and empathy for your fellow man. Ensure credits are filling our coffers, through any legal or ambiguous means. Influence is key; use it wisely to keep certain predicaments under wraps. Wars will be fought over pointless politics. The galaxy's loss, will be our gain.\n\nThis is a business Mr. President, take the board's advice and you will lead §YCzerka Corporation§! into an age of untold opportunities!"

 START_SCREEN_KUAT: "As a primary ship producer for the §BCore Worlds§! during the §HGreat Hyperspace War§!, §YKuat§! proved to be a valuable target for §HSith§! aggression. The shipyards that were once our crowning achievement has been torn down leaving us vulnerable for a future assault. We still have blueprints for ships that allowed us to stand above other nations of the §BCore§! and should start producing more immediately. Our society sits in the center of a crowded galactic §BCore§! that would be all too willing to seize our intellectual property if we show weakness. The humiliation of our defeat can only be removed if we show the galaxy, we can defend ourselves without §YCoruscant's§! protection.\n\nWith the advancements in hyperspace technology we should secure as much territory as possible in order to maintain chokepoints away from §YKuat§! itself. Regardless of the inevitability of galactic political crises to come, §YKuat§! must endure."

 START_SCREEN_AHTO: "§YManaan§! sits in the §BMid Rim§! and has always been vital for galactic security. The §YSelkath§! local to the planet have mastered the art of kolto production making the area a point of interest for §HJedi§! and §HSith§! forces during the §HGreat Hyperspace War§!. Kolto is a substance capable of healing the gravest of wounds making it invaluable to any military campaign waged across the galaxy. To guarantee the safety of our people as well as the kolto refineries scattered across the planet, the §YAhto High Courts§! remained a neutral party in the §HGreat Hyperspace War§! selling kolto to both sides.\n\nThe §YAhto High Courts§! now stand at a crossroads with the galaxy entering an uneasy peace. Rumors are spreading that the §BCore Worlds§! intend to make a formal alliance to guarantee galactic safety for centuries to come. We could use our new hyperdrive technology to bring us closer to this regime, potentially dragging us into future conflicts, or we can stay true to ourselves."

 START_SCREEN_ARKANIAN: "The galaxy is sprawling and there are many new opportunities ahead of us. Our merchants see new markets and new hyperlanes to utilize. Despite the obvious inferiorities of our neighbors, our brilliant scientific minds see new candidates for our genetic prowess. The superiority of the §YArkanians§! will be brought to the larger galaxy."

 START_SCREEN_GUARDIANS: "The §HJedi Order§! do not own the force no matter how often they claim otherwise. The §YWhills§! have taught us the force is something that resides in all beings. During the §HGreat Hyperspace War§! many of these beings were killed, some even by the §HJedi§! despite their supposed adherence to the 'light' side of the force. It is clear to us that the force needs a new protector who will serve it more faithfully than the §HJedi§! have done so far. Thus the §YGuardians of the Whills§! have formed to represent the force itself in the §BCore Worlds§!.\n\nAdvancements in hyperdrive technology has made it safer than ever before to carry our message effectively through the stars. If §YCoruscant§!, the §HJedi§!, and the rest of the §BCore§! refuses to listen to our message we may have to take matters into our own hands. Alternatively, spreading our nation northwards through the §BWestern Reaches§! could allow our people the ability to tell a new audience about the force before the §HJedi's§! twisted view of it reaches them."

 START_SCREEN_MANDALORIAN: "We have inherited the legacy of §YMand'alor the First§!, a §YTaung§! of §HCoruscanta§!. Our legacy is one of war, of conquest, of honor bound traditions. We have brought many into our culture, whether it was through conquest or liberation. They have learned our traditions and have become Mandalorians like us; learned to revel in battle and support your fellow Mandalorian on and off the battlefield.\n\nUnder the guidance of our §YMand'alor§!, we will continue to move out from §YMandalore§! itself, to §YConcord Dawn§!, to §YOrdo§!, to §YMandilla§!, and beyond. We continue to give reverence to Kad Ha'rangir, the god of destruction, as we prepare to expand our borders and influence. This is the way."

 START_SCREEN_SITH_REFUGEES: "We were driven from our world of §YKorriban§! by the §HRepublic§! and the §HJedi§! as retribution for Sadow's invasion of §HCoruscant§!. §YKorriban§! is plundered and our most precious relics are scattered. We are few in number now but the Dark Side still calls to us. Our Emperor has gathered what few of us remain and led us to the jungle world of §YDromund Kaas§! in an attempt to rebuild what was lost.\n\nOne day, the §YSith Empire§! will make its glorious return to the galaxy. One day, the skies of §HCoruscant§! will be darkened by our fleet. But until then, we shall wait in the shadows and rebuild."

 START_SCREEN_TARIS: "The §YTaris Civil Authority§! finds itself licking its wounds from the §HGreat Hyperspace War§!. §HMandalore the Indomitable§! waged a bloody crusade through our territories leaving us vulnerable to future assaults from all sides. While defeated it is important to remember §HMandalore§! sits next to §YTaris§! and could attack us once again if a new leader is settled upon. We must develop our military infrastructure beyond Mandalorian capabilities if we are to survive.\n\nAlthough it is unlikely they would listen, hyperdrive technology upgrades have allowed us to theoretically reach the §BCore Worlds§! so that we could plead our case to §YCoruscant§! directly. If the various Mandalorian clans unify themselves around a singular leader once again the §BCore§! may be our only hope for protection. Striking them quickly might be our only hope to avoid the apocalypse."

 START_SCREEN_ZYGERRIA: "Slavery is the natural order of things. The weak deserve nothing more than to kneel before the strong, bound to our service.'\n\n§YZygerrians§! have always believed this to be true. Our very existence was nothing more than chattel slaves to those §HRakatan§! things. The moment we sensed their strength waned, we took action! They were false rulers as it seemed, their monuments toppled, forts razed and cities devastated. The only thing that remained from their empire, was the §HRakatans§! themselves. We forced them in shackles to erect §YZygerrian§! monuments. The burned forts were rebuilt, and the cities that were flattened under our revolt, rose once again through §HRakatan§! slave labor.\n\nThey couldn't endure the same hardships they put us, when the last §HRakatan§! fell, we knew what had to be done. Their systems, their slaves, their legacy, shall be ours. It's ironic that the §HRakatans§! made such pitiful slaves. For all their might, they failed at being strong."

 START_SCREEN_VERPINE: "The §YVerpine§! have stayed safe within the §BRoche Asteroid Field§! for a millennia. We have stayed out of the galactic politics for most of that time thus avoiding the tragedies created by the §HGreat Hyperspace War§!. In the meantime our hive drones have developed enhanced ship building techniques that allow us to stand up to the strongest communities in the galaxy. Now that isolationism which has protected us for a time must end. \n\nThe destruction caused by the latest great war has exposed many natural resources we could exploit if we grab them. With the Mandalorians gathering strength near our borders, we §YVerpine§! should do the same. Although §HMandalore the Indomitable§! left our hive be during his crusade there is no telling if that peaceful coexistence will continue under new leadership. The galaxy is ours for the taking."

 START_SCREEN_TION: "We are the §H[Root.GetName]§!, remnants of §YXim§!'s Empire, though defeated his legacy may yet live through us.\n\nMany sectors have been snatched away after §YXim§!'s capture. We are in economic ruin, war resources are in low supply, and our populace moral pitiful. It's a grim fate, but one set upon us and we shall face it with the same courage as §YXim§! once did!\n\nA time will come where we must decide if war or diplomacy is the best course of action, the §HUnion§! will continue to expand into the §STionese Cluster§!. §YXim§! had a considerable large empire, we may face other feuding nations, or worse, the Hutts. It is unknown if this empire even still exists, the legends say they were our enemy during §YXim§!'s reign. However, they seem to have fallen off the face of the galaxy. Regardless if the Hutts live, we were once a prominent figure in the Galactic theatre, we will have a power greater than §YXim§!!"

 START_SCREEN_MONCALA: "We have long since recovered from the Long War with our §YQuarren§! neighbors. Now is the time for peace and prosperity, for exploration and adventure. Thanks to the scientific breakthrough of the brilliant scientist §YQ-Viza§! and his hyperdrive, we are able to see more of the galaxy beyond §YDac§!. The galaxy awaits our scientists and engineers!"

 START_SCREEN_HSSKOR: "Beyond §YTrandosha§! and beyond §YKashyyyk§! are star systems home to many species. Our encounter with the §HRepublic§! brought to our attention so many opportunities. It is as if the §YScorekeeper§! blesses us every rotation with new targets. Whether it is as mercenaries, bounty hunters, or slavers, our finest will continue to reap Jagannath points as we expand across the galaxy!"

 START_SCREEN_BOTHAN: "§YBothans§! within our local sector of space can sense a great change in the galaxy is coming. We here always been able to perceive future threats with our inherent ability for espionage and infiltration. The unfortunate disasters associated with the §HGreat Hyperspace War§! has created a power vacuum throughout the §BCore§! that will not be healed easily. Even if the people of §YCoruscant§! manage to pick up the pieces, bad actors within the §BOuter Rim§! will work to secure power.\n\nConducting spy operations in the years leading up to the Hyperspace War has created many enemies for §YBothans§!. The nations who want to take revenge against us will now have their chance to do so without fear of retribution. It is up to us to guarantee our own security for the foreseeable future. The advancements in Hyperdrive technology has given us all the tools we need to make a destiny for ourselves. Perhaps one day we will be a proud face of ensuring galactic peace, even if it is from the shadows."

 START_SCREEN_FALEEN: "The §YNoble Houses of Falleen§! stand strong in the face of adversity. The §HGreat Hyperspace War§! has crippled the §BCore World§! empires leaving the order of the galaxy in flux. We now have the opportunity to reshape galactic society to benefit us above all else. For too long the troubles of the §BMid Rim§! have been ignored in favor of gathering the riches of high society on §HCoruscant§!. For too long have the so-called leaders of the galaxy listened to religious radicals in all political matters. The §YFalleen§! may be seen as violent and manipulative, but at the very least our code of conduct ensures stability.\n\nHyperdrive technology has progressed to the point we can create a truly sustainable interstellar empire. Blood is in the water; it is up to us to bring about a more sophisticated leadership to the §BCore§!."

 START_SCREEN_ONDERON: "Our lineage, the §YOnderon Royal Family§!, was founded by the Dark Jedi §YFreedon Nadd§!. Overcome with disdain for the §YJedi Order§!, §YNadd's§! quest began with an attempt to find the §YSith Empire§!, though instead led him to the Dark Lord of the Sith, §YNaga Sadow§!. §YNadd§! consumed the Dark Lord's knowledge with the thirst of a thousand men, then slew his new master when he he had nothing left to teach, as there can only be one Dark Lord.\n\nAfter claiming the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith, §YNadd§! set out to claim a world for his own purposes. Located within the Inner Rim, the planet §YOnderon§! lay host to a young civilization ripe for conquest. With the dark side surging within him, §YNadd§! slew the barbaric Monarchs in the city of §YIziz§! and assumed the title of King. In his century-long reign he completely transformed §YOnderon§! into a haven steeped in Sith Alchemy and Mysticism.\n\nThis was but a few centuries ago, the fate of §YOnderon§! seeming wrought with involvements by the Sith and Jedi, as well as civil wars and skirmishes with numerous other civilizations. Most recently the §YBeast Wars of Onderon§!, a conflict that had spanned centuries between §YIziz§! and the barbarous §YBeast Riders§!, have finally come to an end. With the union of §YOron Kira§!, the Beast-Lord, and §YGalia§!, our Princess and descendant of §YFreedon Nadd§!, the people of §YIziz§! and the §YBeast Riders§! are now one, and look to the future of §YOnderon§! together."

 START_SCREEN_RODIAN: "While §YRodia§! has been consumed with conflict since the first §YRodian§! step foot out of their caves. Clans of all shapes and sizes have hunted each other for sport to test their skills in deadly combat. As a result, §YRodia§! stayed out of the greatest conflict the galaxy has ever known and has given us an opportunity to take more territory. The §YHutt Empire§! to our north has retreated their borders to lick their wounds. \n\nShortly before the next clan hunt was about to begin, a §YGrand Protector§! has emerged to focus the clans on greater pursuits. Why should §YRodians§! fight amongst themselves when there was an entire galaxy waiting for them? New hyperdrive technology will allow us to seize the stars and test ourselves against new enemies."

 START_SCREEN_HUTT_EMPIRE: "§Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§!, a planet deemed so perfect that the §HInfinite Empire§! took notice and tried to seize it from their rightful rulers. §YArdustagg the Absolute§! drove off the §HInfinite Invaders§! and took control of their starships.\n\nWith §YArdustagg§!'s victory and the blessings from our patron gods, §YArdos§! and §YEvona§!, we look to the stars to claim our destiny. To establish an empire that sprawls across the known galaxy, controlled only by the strongest of Hutts. All other 'empires' will be crushed, and forgotten. Those who are deemed fit, will have the privilege to serve our glorious empire.\n\nWe §YHutts§! must always remember §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! and seek to spread our influence no matter the price!"

 START_SCREEN_PYKE: "Spice has flourished throughout the galaxy in the time before the §HGreat Hyperspace War§!. Addicts of all shapes and sizes have provided a huge amount of credits to our §YSyndicate§!. Prior to the wars end our profits through the §BHydian Way§! were at an all time high. Unfortunately, those credits have dried up seeing as no one wants to risk long distance travel until the new hyperdrive technologies have been adequately tested. We must look for new places to trade spice.\n\nThe §HHutt Empire§! to our south have always been a thorn in our sides syphoning credits from our trade deals at every opportunity. In their weakened state the §HHutts§! are vulnerable to an attack from our forces. Perhaps we can make a new group of addicts that will spend more credits on the spice. No matter what happens the spice belongs to the Syndicate, and we will do everything necessary to protect it."

 START_SCREEN_MUUN: "§YMuunilinst§! has always been a safe place to store and exchange credits. It's position within the §BOuter Rim§! territories has made the planet safe from the galactic troubles of the galaxy. The §HGreat Hyperspace War§! has left pre established heavy weights in the realms of politics up ended. The §BCore Worlds§! will need a guiding hand to restore order to the natural way of things. Members in the high echelons of our society has called upon our leadership to aid in the reconstruction efforts.\n\nIf the §YMuuns§! were willing to restructure our own government we can enter the galactic stock exchange. Our previous experience storing credits make us a natural fit to take on even more responsibilities. Who would really notice if we take a few extra credits off the top?"

 START_SCREEN_IRIDONIAN: "We §YIridonians§! have always been determined to create our own future. From the moment we stepped out of the caves of §YIridonia§!, we have had to struggle to survive. It was as though the planet itself has been trying to stagnate before reaching the stars, yet we have endured. So, it was no surprise to us that we have managed to weather the storm of the §HGreat Hyperspace War§! intact. Though the damage inflicted to the §BMid Rim§! has been extensive, yet we are still alive. With the galaxy having been torn down has only given us the opportunity to prove our worth as a valuable member of galactic society.\n\nHyperdrives have been upgraded for safe interstellar travel. Stationed in the §BMid Rim§!, we have the possibility to expand as we wish and act as a gateway between the §BCore§! and the §BOuter Rim§!. The fate of our people and by extension the galaxy rests in our hands."

 START_SCREEN_TOGRUTA: "The §YTogruta§! have always stood together no matter the challenges facing our people. Standing as one has always benefited us more than isolating our people in the shadows. The disasters of the §HGreat Hyperspace War§! can only be mended together. And now the galaxy has a chance to mirror §YTogrutan§! way of life solidifying safety and security for all. The §BCore Worlds§! which have been divided in the past are showing signs that they wish to create a united front to face threats in the future.\n\nUnfortunately, our distance from the §BCore§! makes it difficult for us to join the new union. Although hyperdrive upgrades have made it possible to travel interstellar space, several empires could potentially stand in our way. We will need to move with haste if we could have a chance at joining this new galactic order before threats in the §BOuter Rim§! swallow us whole."

 START_SCREEN_TWILEK: "Although most citizens within the galaxy saw the §HGreat Hyperspace War§! as a day of great sorrow, the §YTwi'leks§! of §YRyloth§! saw it as a day of freedom. The §HHutt Empire§! can no longer sustain its control over our territory. For the first time in a millennia we can control our own destiny. Everything from a government to military infrastructure must be developed from the ground up to suit our needs. The §BOuter Rim§! can be a dangerous place full of species that would love to take advantage of us.\n\nThe recent advancements in safe hyperdrive technologies will only accelerate our plans. We should spread our people to more places throughout the stars if we are to preserve our freedoms. Our fate is now ours to determine, let's not ruin it."

 START_SCREEN_MALASTARE: "§YMalastare§! has always been important to the galaxy due to our position within the §BHydian Way§!. Trade between the §BCore Worlds§! and the §BOuter Rim§! flows through our territories at least before the §HGreat Hyperspace War§!. We profited from the mere shipment of goods through our space rather than the production of goods, that will need to change. Now everything from trade to mere transportation has been extremely difficult meaning we must adapt to a shifting galaxy if we are to survive. Fuels under the surface of §YMalastare§! could potentially be needed in space flight. Mining these fuels could make us an even more vital center piece in galactic power if we are willing to gather the resource.\n\nAlternatively, spice that once came almost exclusively from the §BOuter Rim§! will need a new supplier. If we are willing to risk the §BOuter Rim's§! wrath cutting them out of the spice business, we can make substantial credit gains. Regardless of how we make our credits, hyperdrive enhancements have been made to more safely travel the stars. Developing our place in the §BHydian Way§! must be our top priority."

 START_SCREEN_EXCHANGE: "The galaxy is presenting new opportunities for us. New hyperlanes for our smugglers, new markets for slaves, and new targets for our bounty hunters. It's obvious that we aren't the only ones aware of this. The §HHutts§!, §HZygerrians§!, and the upstart §HPykes§! are no doubt plotting their own expansion in the §BOuter Rim§!. It's only a matter of time before we will have to do something about the competition."

 START_SCREEN_SOROSUB: "§YSullustans§! have stuck to themselves for a long time on §YSullust§! in safety believing we had nothing to contribute to the galaxy. Even though we have always been excellent ship builders, the galaxy has relied upon the likes of §YKuat§!, §YCorellia§!, and §YDac§! for engineering needs. The §HGreat Hyperspace War§! has changed all that giving us the opportunity to bring our skills to the table. Species located within the south side of the galaxy will need reliable ships to weather the coming storm. \n\nAdvancements to hyperdrive technologies will allow us to spread our designs to new races. Credits are on the table waiting for us to snatch them up."

 START_SCREEN_CHISS: "Long before the ice, the §YChiss§! people knew the simple pleasure of having the sun shone on us. Everything changed when the ice came. Pushed underground, we had to adapt to survive. Here we learned what it takes to survive the harshness of unpredictableness.
