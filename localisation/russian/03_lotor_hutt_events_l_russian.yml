 lotor_hutt_events.202.desc: "With hyperlanes reopening across the galaxy, reestablishing contact with some of our vassals is important. Of all the species we've taken in, the §Y[target_planet.owner_main_species.GetNamePlural]§! have been the most receptive to our rule.

 lotor_hutt_events.203.desc: "Reestablishing communications with the Gamorreans was relatively simple, though actually making them listen has proven quite difficult.

 lotor_hutt_events.210.desc.weequay: "When the recovery team arrives, they discover several wounded Weequay, including a prominent chieftain of a major clan. The survivors have their wounds treated by our finest doctors and a smaller craft is donated to them. In exchange for our help, the chieftain is willing to let some of his people live in the Hutt space or allow us to establish a formal presence on §YSriluur§!.\nOur relationship with their kind extends as far back as the war with §HXim§! and our people know the hardy nature of the Weequay is a valuable asset." #NT!
 lotor_hutt_events.210.desc.klatoonians: "The Klatoonians revere us as the near-gods and their willingness to remain subservient is evident. It does not take much for them to be brought in under our rule once more.\nThe question now is should we allow their kind on our worlds or establish a presence on theirs?" #NT!
 lotor_hutt_events.210.desc.gamorreans: "The Gamorreans are amused by our unexpected show of force and respect our willingness in resorting to violence.

 lotor_hutt_events.231.desc: "The storms come and go, causing minimal damage to the Fountain but killing off a good number of paddyfrogs, effectively ruining this year's harvest. However, the Klatooinians are thankful that they have supplies to keep them comfortable the remainder of the year.\n\nThe §BCouncil of Elders§! is beyond gracious for the contribution toward the Klatooinian populace and will continue to view us as benevolent gods." #NT!

The storms come and go, causing minimal damage to the Fountain and leaving the paddyfrog plantations with minimal damage.\n\nThe §BCouncil of Elders§! is beyond gracious for the contribution toward their people and will continue to revere us as benevolent gods. For our efforts, they are gifting us their yearly harvest." #NT!

While the destruction of much of §Y[This.GetName]§!'s infrastructure provided an excellent basis for our research, the damage to the planet has been substantial.\n\nThe §BCouncil of Elders§! is frustrated with our passive response to their request for assistance, though their mood shifts positivity when our research has provided a breakthrough to prevent future storms of this nature." #NT!

 lotor_hutt_events.235.desc: "Your Corpulence, the Gamorreans are starting to threaten our holdings on §Y[This.GetName]§! with their incessant fighting.

 lotor_hutt_events.236.a: "Lets hope it stays that way." #NT!
 lotor_hutt_events.237.desc: "Your magnificence, the fighting has spread into our settlements, causing the destruction of several homes and thanks to a few young boars, the leveling of a fine crafts shop. It will take some time to repair the damage but at least no lives are lost." #NT!

 lotor_hutt_events.241.desc: "A group of §Y[weequay_species.GetName]§! ships were intercepted leaving §Y[This.System.GetName]§! by customs officials.

 lotor_hutt_events.243.desc: "The pirate captain makes their case, offering local authorities their fair share of the loot, provided that their crew gets first pick on the loot and majority of the profits; as well as all the proper handling fees associated with such transactions. Unsurprisingly, the §YHutts§! and customs agents refuse.\n\nNegotiations last for several hours as the pirate captain tries to talk their way out of their imprisonment. Out of frustration, they offer their services on behalf of all of the §Y[weequay_species.GetName]§! on §Y[sriluur_planet.GetName]§! to help keep the hyperlanes between §Y[This.GetName]§! and §Y[sriluur_planet.GetName]§! clear from other marauding gangs." #NT!

 lotor_hutt_events.244.desc: "The absolute gall of the captain to try and bargain their way out of a prison sentence did not amuse them. Bribery is one thing but insulting the capabilities of the §YHutt§! military is something all together different.\n\nWith a simple hand gesture, the §Y[weequay_species.GetName]§! are taken away." #NT!
 lotor_hutt_events.245.desc: "The §YHutts§! and customs agents laugh at the absurdity of the proposal. The absolute gall of a Weequay captain and their crew of pirates to suggest that the Hutt navy is too weak to handle pirates amuses them greatly.\n\nIn addition to protecting the hyperlanes from other pirate gangs, the Weequay are to ensure that their own gangs remain subservient to the §YHutts§! and only raid their competition.  The pirate captain ponders this proposal and readily accepts.\n\nWith a simple hand gesture, the §Y[weequay_species.GetName]§! are escorted back to their ship and are sent on their way." #NT!
