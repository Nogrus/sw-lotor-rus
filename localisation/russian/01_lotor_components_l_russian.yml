### Cloaking Generator
 CLOAKING_GENERATOR_1: "Stygium Cloaking Generator MKI"
 CLOAKING_GENERATOR_1_DESC: "This first generation Stygium Cloak is crude and prone to reliability issues, but when active, it can mask a ship's emissions and visual profile from both sensors and the naked eye."
 CLOAKING_GENERATOR_2: "Stygium Cloaking Generator MKII"
 CLOAKING_GENERATOR_2_DESC: "An improvement upon the first generation Stygium Cloak, this second-generation model has improved power management, allowing it to effectively conceal larger vessels for longer."
 CLOAKING_GENERATOR_3: "Stygium Cloaking Generator MKIII"
 CLOAKING_GENERATOR_3_DESC: "Breakthroughs in the stygium refining process have made for a powerful and effective cloaking field capable of concealing most vessels comfortably and reliably."
 CLOAKING_GENERATOR_4: "Stygium Cloaking Generator MKIV"
 CLOAKING_GENERATOR_4_DESC: "The apex of cloaking generator technology, the Mark IV Cloak utilizes strains of adegan to bolster the stygium, producing a cloaking field powerful enough of concealing even the largest vessels within our fleet."
