 lotor_republic_events.800.desc: "The time has come for us all to achieve something more than this broad coming together of our great civilizations. We've established a magnificent union for both ourselves and any who would join in the hope that justice and prosperity will thrive in the Galaxy, providing other less fortunate societies with the chance of making their words heard and receiving proper representation. This, however, may not be enough as we continue to encounter new threats to our great democracy and all that we've built. The proposition has been made that we, the founding members of the §YGalactic Republic§! and the Senate, come together to form a singular political and military entity, encompassing all of our territories and continuing with Coruscant as the center of power.\n\nCurrently, the §YGalactic Republic§! is seen as an alliance of our great communities. What we will become, if decided, is a no longer an alliance of these communities, but instead a single, immense community established in the center of the Galaxy. Our military, our people, and our planets will not simply be that of our individual nations, but of the §YGalactic Republic§!."

# Taris Republic AID
 lotor_republic_events.1500.name: "Ask for Help?"
 lotor_republic_events.1500.desc: "The §YMandalorians§! and their ever aggressive nature have always been a nuisance on the edge of our territory. Today this nuisance may have evolved into a full blown crisis. Reports have come in of a §YMandalorian§! force beyond anything we've ever seen, moving from planet to planet and annihilating their defenses before they can call for support. A number of smaller planets and systems have fallen and are currently under the control of what seems to be the newly unified §YMandalorian Clans§!. Worse yet, our scouts confirm that systems under our control are their next target. We can expect either an unprompted invasion of our systems or a formal declaration of war within days.\n\nOur defenses may be formidable enough to thwart local threats from surrounding systems, but will likely fall short in the face of a full scale invasion from an organized §YMandalorian§! force. That being the case it should be a top priority to request support from any and all allies, most importantly the §YRepublic§!. While the §YRepublic§! has been reluctant to become involved with situations in the §BOuter Rim§! in the past, news of a recovered and united §YMandalorian Clans§! wreaking havoc on numerous civilizations may spur them into action.\n\nAlternatively, we can attempt to resist this threat on our own. The pride of our military might is at stake, and looking to others to defend us as soon as a threat arises may diminish our reputation. The §YTarisian§! military is powerful and we stand primed to make any invader pay dearly with our defensive tactics. But would would such a risk be worth it simply to protect our pride?"

While we have confirmed some reports of §YMandalorian§! clans expanding their territory, such a rapid strengthening of their forces and aggressive invasions were beyond what we believed possible in such a short amount of time.\n\nRegardless, if what the §YTarisians§! say is true, their projections put §YTaris§! next in line for the wave of §YMandalorian§! invaders. It is for this reason that the §YTaris Civil Authority§! is petitioning the §YRepublic§! for military and logistical support in the face of imminent invasion. The §YTarisian§! military is strong enough to discourage most threats in the §BOuter Rim§! and have proven themselves capable in battle. This makes their plea for support all the more worrying.\n\nOur Admirals and Generals advise us that we could send naval forces to assist the §YTarisians§!, but given the distance from §YCoruscant§! and the isolation of §YTaris§!, including a shipment of resources would be worthwhile to bolster their defensive efforts. If resources cannot be sent, then a defensive military campaign is still entirely viable, though may lack sustainability. Of course if we cannot spare the resources or forces, or if we believe the §YTarisians§! will be able to handle the §YMandalorians§!, we are not compelled to provide anything. But can we really afford to let a threat like the §YMandalorians§! fester in the §BOuter Rim§! unchecked?"
 lotor_republic_events.1510.a: "We will send reinforcements and resources to assist."
 lotor_republic_events.1510.b: "We will send reinforcements to assist."
 lotor_republic_events.1510.c: "We are sorry, but we cannot spare anything to assist."

The §YRepublic§! has responded to our call with nothing more than condolences and well wishes as they continue to sit safely in the §BInner Rim§!. We were foolish to expect support from an entity that puts only its own interests first. Regardless, we cannot rely exclusively on others for our survival, and in the end this fight is our own. We can only hope that we can stand against the §YMandalorian§! menace."

 lotor_republic_events.1600.name: "A Galaxy in Flames"
 lotor_republic_events.1600.desc: "Conflict and hostile incursions are a regularly occurring circumstance in the Galaxy, impossible to be avoid over the long term as civilizations continue to grow and evolve. Even with all of our strength, the §YRepublic§! is not exempt from these conflicts, both on our own behalf and those we're allied with. But rare is a war with repercussions that echo throughout all of known space. And now, one such war has come.\n\nThe §YRepublic§! and the united §HMandalorian Clans§! are at war. A few decades prior even the suggestion that the §HMandalorians§! would pose a threat to the Galaxy would be met with laughter. But in the complacency by which our §YRepublic§! conducted itself we've allowed the §HMandalorian§! threat to fester in the §BOuter Rim§! to the point of open war. The time has come to face these united §HMandalorian Clans§! and halt their invasion, not only to prevent the fall of §YRepublic§! worlds, but to safeguard the rest of the Galaxy from this menace."

 lotor_republic_events.2000.desc: "As the §HMandalorian Crusades§! continue to rage in the §BOuter Rim§! and fringe §YRepublic§! territories, positive news has come out of §YCoruscant§!. Following numerous defeats and losses against the §HMandalorians§!, the §YJedi§! have finally decided to assist in the war effort! While not joining en masse, a large number of the §YJedi§! have joined the §YRepublic Mercy Corps§!, a detachment of the §YRepublic§! military consisting entirely of volunteers.\n\nStrangely enough the Jedi are not led by a member of the Jedi Council, nor a Jedi Master. Instead, a charismatic Jedi Knight named §HRevan§! leads the numerous Jedi volunteers in an attempt to halt the §HMandalorian§! menace from conquering any deeper into civilized space. Many of these Jedi are young, only some of them having fought in past conflicts throughout the §BGalaxy§!, but their mastery over the force and their training will be an invaluable boon to §YRepublic§! forces. In addition, many Jedi may also assume advisory and support roles given the sheer magnitude of the war effort.\n\n§YRepublic§! forces have begun a swift remobilization with this encouraging news. An all time low in morale from losses on the battlefield and disheartening news from the §BOuter Rim§! has turned, bolstered into a vigorous confidence at the Jedi's commitment to the war effort. Troops, equipment, and ships have been pooled from a number of fleets in §YRepublic§! space to form the backbone of a new task force intent on deterring the §HMandalorians§! and sending them back from whence they came. Alongside the Jedi they cannot fail."

Today, the Jedi have joined the Mercy Corps and, alongside the Republic military, shall set course to halt the invasion in the Outer Rim. To any and all still in the path of the Mandalorian menace, remember, there is hope. We are on our way. We will not stop until there is justice, until the Mandalorians have been defeated once and for all. So swears I, Revan!"

 lotor_republic_events.2100.desc: "The §HMandalorian§! menace continues to decimate those who oppose them and conquer system after system. Many §YRepublic§! fleets have attempted to halt, or at least slow the advance of the savage invaders, though few have found success. One such individual that has, however, is §HAdmiral Saul Karath§!. Hailing from §YCorellia§!, the Admiral worked his way up the ranks quickly through his effort and dedication to his comrades. The Admiral has recently become one of the first to triumph over the §HMandalorians§! multiple times in succession, garnering him a reputation among §YRepublic§! and §HMandalorian§! troops alike.\n\nGiven the current state of the war effort, §HAdmiral Karath§! is being granted an additional fleet along with an immediate assignment to the Mercy Corps alongside the Jedi Knights and their leader, §HRevan§!. §HRevan§!'s second in command, a Jedi Knight named §HAlek§!, has also developed a reputation as a strong leader and tactician in recent months. Between the Admiral, the Jedi, and the additional fleet at their disposal, expectations are optimistic that the tide of the war may turn in the §YRepublic§!'s favor."

 lotor_republic_events.2110.desc: "I have witnessed cities reduced to ash. Fleets shredded into derelict graveyards. Entire planets aflame from the use of weapons so unspeakable to turn on civilian targets. The Mandalorians are unlike any foe one would expect to face. They are not fighting for territory or resources or some political motivation. They revel in the fight itself. They want to fight those they deem worthy... and simply destroy those that are not. They must be stopped, no matter the cost."

 lotor_republic_events.2200.name: "Escalation of the Mandalorian Crusade III"
 lotor_republic_events.2200.desc: "The §HMandalorians§! grow ever closer, their Crusade engulfing more of the §BGalaxy§! with every passing day. §YRepublic§! forces have tried in vain to stop them, finding mixed success by the best projections. As losses mount, morale plummets, not only among the troops but among the citizenry as well. Word throughout the §YRepublic§! has shifted from questions about when the §HMandalorians§! will be stopped to fearful questions of who will be next. Military leadership are beginning to express concern at the current state of affairs.\n\nThe one exception to this poor performance against the §HMandalorians§! is the Mercy Corps, led by §HAdmiral Saul Karath§! and §HJedi Knight §HRevan§!§!, who've found multiple victories in the conflict. Many soldiers look to the §YMercy Corps§! for hope and inspiration in these desperate times. Moreover, some go one step past looking to their example. It has come to our attention that §YAdmiral [event_target:unknown_corps_admiral.GetRealName]§! has left their current post to join with the §YMercy Corps§! and lend their expertise. §YAdmiral [event_target:unknown_corps_admiral.GetRealName]§! expressed their distaste at our progress and decision making in regards to the conflict at hand, though nobody could have anticipated this development."

 lotor_republic_events.2210.desc: "The Mandalorians are the single greatest threat to the Republic. This is the unequivocal truth. That being the case, I can't help but find that my abilities are wasted as this threat continues to brutalize planet after planet. The Jedi Knight Revan and Admiral Karath are the only ones forging a clear path for us to end this conflict once and for all. It's for this reason that I §H[event_target:unknown_corps_admiral.GetRealName]§! am leaving my post, effective immediately, with the intent of joining the Mercy Corps and help bring this war to its conclusion."

Crusade has been slain by none other than the Jedi Knight §HRevan§!, though it apparently has come at great cost. Immeasurable losses have been sustained on both sides of the conflict, with the surviving §YMandalorians§! scattering into the void and remaining §YRepublic§! forces regrouping in the §BOuter Rim§! before a planned return to §YRepublic§! space.\n\nThough strangely enough only a small portion of the §YRepublic§! forces and a single Jedi have returned to §YRepublic§! space. Final transmissions from §HRevan§! and other §YRepublic§! leaders in the §BOuter Rim§! claim a sizable force of §YMandalorians§! fled into the Unknown Regions and they are pursuing them to end the threat permanently. Any attempts to contact the §YRepublic§! forces since these transmissions have gone unanswered. With no method of contact into the Unknown Regions and the sheer vastness of the uncharted space, word likely won't come of them until their eventual return.\n\nBoth our military leadership and the §HJedi Council§! are concerned by this development, each organization expressing to that returning to §YRepublic§! space should be paramount after such a long campaign. The §YMandalorian§! invasion has shaken the Galaxy and left the §YRepublic§! and numerous other civilizations weakened. A lengthy period of recovery and repair is in order, and the sudden departure of both numerous §YRepublic§! forces and Jedi may impede this process. We can only hope that they will return soon with good news and with their remaining forces intact.\n\n§RMercy Corps Forces disappear alongside their Fleets§!."
